<BR><BR>[0001]This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent
     Application 61/062,470, filed Jan. 25, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent
     Application 61/060,641, filed Jun. 11, 2008, the contents of both of
     which are incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0003]This invention relates to wireless networks. More specifically, it
     relates to passive voice enabled radio frequency identifier (RFID)
     network devices powered by converting electromagnetic energy to
     electrical voltage and current.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0004]Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) is a technology providing
     automatic identification of objects, relying on, storing and remotely
     retrieving data using devices called RFID tags or transponders.
<BR><BR>[0005]An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into
     a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification using
     radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond
     the line of sight of the reader.
<BR><BR>[0006]RFID tags come in three general varieties: passive, active, or
     semi-passive (also known as battery-assisted). Passive tags require no
     internal power source, thus being pure passive devices (they are only
     active when a reader is nearby to power them), whereas semi-passive and
     active tags require a power source, usually a small battery.
<BR><BR>[0007]Recent industry standardization activities from the International
     Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU),
     ITU-T (www.itu.int/ITU-T/worksem/rfid/program.html) and Institute of
     Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), IEEE 1451.7
     (www.sensorsportal.com/HTML/standard_7.htm) subcommittee in defining
     communication methods and data formats for transducers (sensors and
     actuators) communicating with RFID tags indicated an emerging trend of
     combining RFID into sensors and/or sensor enhanced RFID tags to maximize
     the use of a wide variety of applications for detection, identification
     and tracking purposes.
<BR><BR>[0008]RFID provides the means of tracking and identifying sensing objects
     and sensors provide information about the condition of the objects. The
     combination of these two technologies creates great opportunities to
     provide specialized sensors such as Data, Information and Knowledge
     (DIaK) sensors and sensor tracking extended services as part of
     capabilities offered by Integrated Systems Health Management (ISHM).
<BR><BR>[0009]This trend has significant impact on advanced ground testing methods
     based on smart sensor technologies that are crucial to the development,
     qualification, and flight certification many complex technologies such
     defense technologies, rockets engines, etc. The ability to quickly and
     efficiently perform ground system certification greatly impacts all space
     programs.
<BR><BR>[0010]There are a number of problems associated with combining
     technologies into RFID tags. One problem is that combination RFID tags
     and sensors are governed electromagnetic principles. Electrical circuits
     need a power source such as a battery or need to be capable of generating
     continual power for a device.
<BR><BR>[0011]Another problem is that to communicate, RFID tags respond to queries
     generating signals that must not create interference with RFID readers,
     as arriving RF signals can be very weak and need to be distinguished.
<BR><BR>[0012]Another problem is that RFID tags and smart sensors need to be
     capable of communicating with each other at any time without being
     compromised by interruption from power shortage either passively induced
     or actively on battery.
<BR><BR>[0013]Another problem with RFID tags is that they do not have the ability
     to process voice information. Voice information typically requires
     significant continual power.
<BR><BR>[0014]For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,348,884 that issued to Higham entitled
     "RFID cabinet," teaches An RFID for cabinet for monitoring items having
     an RFID tag includes a cabinet having at least one locking front door. An
     RFID detector is used for monitoring each item placed within the cabinet
     and is located within the interior of the cabinet. A computer is coupled
     to the RFID cabinet and controls opening and closing of the front door
     and is configured to receive an input that identifies the user. In this
     way, the computer is configured to periodically record data read from the

<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0022]In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention,
     some of the problems associated with RFID devices are overcome.
<BR><BR>[0023]Voice enabled RFID network devices are presented. The Voice enabled
     RFID network devices include a power harvesting circuit that converts
     near by natural energy sources to voltage and current to power the
     device. Thus, this voice enable passive RFID network does not require a
     battery. It provides a voice capable RFID network with a power harvesting
     circuit that is powered by harvesting energy from various artificial or
     energy sources and/or natural energy sources such as: voice signals,
     other electromagnetic waves, sun light, vibrations, RF noise, etc. This
     passively powered energy harvesting technique can also be applied to
     cellular devices, MP3 devices, smart phones, netbook and other types of
     network devices or electrical devices that typically require and use
     battery power for producing direct current (DC).
<BR><BR>[0024]The foregoing and other features and advantages of preferred
     embodiments of the present invention will be more readily apparent from
     the following detailed description. The detailed description proceeds
     with references to the accompanying drawings.
<BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Exemplary Communications System
<BR><BR>[0032]FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary communications system 10.
     In one embodiment, the communications network includes a mesh network
     with a local area network (LAN) that employs one of two connection
     arrangements, "full mesh topology" or "partial mesh topology." In the
     full mesh topology, plural nodes 12, 14, 16, 18 are connected directly to
     each of the others. In the partial mesh topology some nodes are connected
     to all the others, but some of the nodes are connected only to those
     other nodes (e.g., those with which they exchange the most data, etc.).
     The connections can be wired 20 or wireless 22. A mesh network is
     reliable and offers redundancy. If one node can no longer operate, all
     the rest can still communicate with each other, directly or through one
     or more intermediate nodes. Mesh networks work well when the nodes are
     located at scattered points that do not lie near a common line.
<BR><BR>[0033]The plural nodes include 12, 14, 16, 18 but are not limited to,
     network devices including sensors, Remote Frequency Identifier (RFID)
     devices, Bluetooth devices or Zigbee, multimedia capable desktop and
     laptop computers, facsimile machines, mobile phones, non-mobile phones,
     Internet phones, Internet appliances, personal digital/data assistants
     (PDA), two-way pagers, digital cameras, televisions and other types of
     network devices. The plural network devices include one or more of a
     wired interface and/or a wireless interface used to connect to a mesh
     network to provide voice, video and data communications.
<BR><BR>[0034]Selected ones of the plural nodes 12-18 are connected to a
     communications network 24. The communications network 24 includes, but is
     not limited to, a mesh network, a partial mesh network, an RFID network,
     the Internet, an intranet, a wired Local Area Network (LAN), a wireless
     LAN (WiLAN), a wireless personal area network (WPAN), wireless Wide Area
     Network (WAN), a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), a Public
     Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and other types of wireless and wired
     communications networks 24.
<BR><BR>[0035]The communications network 24 may include one or more gateways,
     routers, bridges, switches. As is known in the art, a gateway connects
     computer networks using different network protocols and/or operating at
     different transmission capacities. A router receives transmitted messages
     and forwards them to their correct destinations over the most efficient
     available route. A bridge is a device that connects networks using the
     same communications protocols so that information can be passed from one
     network device to another. A switch is a device that filters and forwards
     packets between network segments. Switches typically operate at the data
     link layer and sometimes the network layer and therefore support
     virtually any packet protocol.
<BR><BR>[0036]The plural nodes 12-18 may be connected to one or more server
     network devices (not illustrated) include one or more associated
     databases. The one or more server devices are in communication with the
     plural nodes via the communications network 24. The one or more server
     network devices include, but are not limited to, World Wide Web servers,
     Internet servers, file servers, other types of electronic information
     servers, and other types of server network devices (e.g., edge servers,
     firewalls, routers, gateways, etc.). The one or more server network
     devices 30 may be included inside a building or outside a building.
<BR><BR>[0037]The system 10 further includes an RFID controller/RFID portal 26 and
     plural RFID devices 28 (only one of which is illustrated). The RFID
     controller/RFID portal 26 stores and remotely retrieves data using
     devices called RFID transponders 28.
<BR><BR>[0038]Preferred embodiments of the present invention include network
     devices and interfaces that are compliant with all or part of standards
     proposed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE),
     International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization
     Sector (ITU), European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),
     Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), U.S. National Institute of
     Security Technology (NIST), American National Standard Institute (ANSI),
     Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Forum, Bluetooth Forum, or the ADSL
     Forum. However, network devices based on other standards could also be
     used. IEEE standards can be found on the World Wide Web at the Universal
     Resource Locator (URL) "www.ieee.org." The ITU, (formerly known as the

<BR><BR>[0039]An operating environment for devices and interfaces of the present
     invention include a processing system with one or more high speed Central
     Processing Unit(s) (CPU) and a memory. In accordance with the practices
     of persons skilled in the art of computer programming, the present
     invention is described below with reference to acts and symbolic
     representations of operations or instructions that are performed by the
     processing system, unless indicated otherwise. Such acts and operations
     or instructions are referred to as being "computer-executed," "CPU
     executed" or "processor executed."
<BR><BR>[0040]It will be appreciated that acts and symbolically represented
     operations or instructions include the manipulation of electrical signals
     by the CPU. An electrical system represents data bits which cause a
     resulting transformation or reduction of the electrical signals, and the
     maintenance of data bits at memory locations in a memory system to
     thereby reconfigure or otherwise alter the CPU's operation, as well as
     other processing of signals. The memory locations where data bits are
     maintained are physical locations that have particular electrical,
     magnetic, optical, or organic properties corresponding to the data bits.
<BR><BR>[0041]The data bits may also be maintained on a computer readable medium
     including magnetic disks, optical disks, organic memory, and any other
     volatile (e.g., Random Access Memory (RAM)) or non-volatile (e.g.,
     Read-Only Memory (ROM)) mass storage system readable by the CPU. The
     computer readable medium includes cooperating or interconnected computer
     readable medium, which exist exclusively on the processing system or be
     distributed among multiple interconnected processing systems that may be
     local or remote to the processing system.
<BR><BR>[0042]As is known in the art, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
     reference model is a layered architecture that standardizes levels of
     service and types of interaction for computers exchanging information
     through a communications network. The OSI reference model separates
     network device-to-network device communications into seven protocol
     layers, or levels, each building-and relying--upon the standards
     contained in the levels below it. The OSI reference model includes from
     lowest-to-highest, a physical, data-link, network, transport, session,
     presentation and application layer. The lowest of the seven layers deals
     solely with hardware links; the highest deals with software interactions
     at the application-program level.
<BR><BR>[0043]In one embodiment of the present invention, the wireless interfaces
     include but are not limited to, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g,
     802.11n, 802.15.4 (ZigBee), "Wireless Fidelity" (Wi-Fi), "Worldwide
     Interoperability for Microwave Access" (WiMAX), ETSI High Performance
     Radio Metropolitan Area Network (HIPERMAN) or "RF Home" wireless
     interfaces. In another embodiment of the present invention, the wireless
     sensor device may include an integral or separate Bluetooth and/or infra
     data association (IrDA) module for wireless Bluetooth or wireless
     infrared communications. (not illustrated). However, the present
     invention is not limited to such an embodiment and other 802.11xx and
     other types of wireless interfaces can also be used.
<BR><BR>[0044]As is known in the art, an 802.11b is a short-range wireless network
     standard. The IEEE 802.11b standard defines wireless interfaces that
     provide up to 11 Mbps wireless data transmission to and from wireless
     devices over short ranges. 802.11a is an extension of the 802.11b and can
     deliver speeds up to 54M bps. 802.11g deliver speeds on par with 802.11a.
     However, other 802.11X interfaces can also be used and the present
     invention is not limited to the 802.11 protocols defined. The IEEE
     802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g standards are incorporated herein by
     reference.
<BR><BR>[0045]As is known in the art, Wi-Fi is a type of 802.11xx interface,
     whether 802.11b, 802.11a, dual-band, etc. Wi-Fi devices include an RF
     interfaces such as 2.4 GHz for 802.11b or 802.11g and 5 GHz for 802.11a.
     More information on Wi-Fi can be found at the URL "www.weca.net."
<BR><BR>[0046]As is known in the art, 802.15.4 (Zigbee) is low data rate network
     standard used for mesh network devices such as sensors, interactive toys,
     smart badges, remote controls, and home automation. The 802.15.4 standard
     provides data rates of 250 kbps, 40 kbps, and 20 kbps., two addressing
     modes; 16-bit short and 64-bit IEEE addressing, support for critical
     latency devices, such as joysticks, Carrier Sense Multiple
     Access/Collision Avoidance, (CSMA-CA) channel access, automatic network
     establishment by a coordinator, fully handshaked protocol for transfer
     reliability, power management to ensure low power consumption for
     multi-month to multi-year battery usage and up to 16 channels in the 2.4
     GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band (Worldwide), 10
     channels in the 915 MHz (US) and one channel in the 868 MHz band
     (Europe). The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard is incorporated herein by
     reference. More information on 802.15.4 and ZigBee can be found at the
     URL "www.ieee802.org" and "www.zigbee.org" respectively.
<BR><BR>[0047]As is known in the art, WiMAX is an industry trade organization
     formed by leading communications component and equipment companies to
     promote and certify compatibility and interoperability of broadband
     wireless access equipment that conforms to the IEEE 802.16XX and ETSI
     HIPERMAN. HIPERMAN is the European standard for metropolitan area
     networks (MAN).
<BR><BR>[0048]The IEEE The 802.16a and 802.16g standards are wireless MAN
     technology standard that provides a wireless alternative to cable, DSL
     and TI/El for last mile broadband access. It is also used as
     complimentary technology to connect IEEE 802.11XX hot spots to the
     Internet.
<BR><BR>[0049]The IEEE 802.16a standard for 2-11 GHz is a wireless MAN technology
     that provides broadband wireless connectivity to fixed, portable and
     nomadic devices. It provides up to 50-kilometers of service area range,
     allows users to get broadband connectivity without needing direct line of
     sight with the base station, and provides total data rates of up to 280
     Mbps per base station, which is enough bandwidth to simultaneously
     support hundreds of businesses with T1/E1-type connectivity and thousands
     of homes with DSL-type connectivity with a single base station. The IEEE
     802.16g provides up to 100 Mbps.
<BR><BR>[0050]The IEEE 802.16e standard is an extension to the approved IEEE
     802.16/16a/16g standard. The purpose of 802.16e is to add limited
     mobility to the current standard which is designed for fixed operation.
<BR><BR>[0051]The ESTI HIPERMAN standard is an interoperable broadband fixed
     wireless access standard for systems operating at radio frequencies
     between 2 GHz and 11 GHz.
<BR><BR>[0052]The IEEE 802.16a, 802.16e and 802.16g standards are incorporated
     herein by reference. More information on WiMAX can be found at the URL
     "www.wimaxforum.org." WiMAX can be used to provide a WLP.

<BR><BR>Security and Encryption
<BR><BR>[0054]Devices and interfaces of the present invention may include security
     and encryption for secure communications. Wireless Encryption Protocol
     (WEP) (also called "Wired Equivalent Privacy) is a <B><I>security protocol</I></B> for
     WiLANs defined in the IEEE 802.11b standard. WEP is cryptographic privacy
     algorithm, based on the Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) encryption engine, used to
     provide confidentiality for 802.11b wireless data.
<BR><BR>[0055]As is known in the art, RC4 is cipher designed by RSA Data Security,
     Inc. of Bedford, Mass., which can accept encryption keys of arbitrary
     length, and is essentially a pseudo random number generator with an
     output of the generator being XORed with a data stream to produce
     encrypted data.
<BR><BR>[0056]One problem with WEP is that it is used at the two lowest layers of
     the OSI model, the physical layer and the data link layer, therefore, it
     does not offer end-to-end security. One another problem with WEP is that
     its encryption keys are static rather than dynamic. To update WEP
     encryption keys, an individual has to manually update a WEP key. WEP also
     typically uses 40-bit static keys for encryption and thus provides "weak
     encryption," making a WEP device a target of hackers.
<BR><BR>[0057]The IEEE 802.11 Working Group is working on a security upgrade for
     the 802.11 standard called "802.11i." This supplemental draft standard is
     intended to improve WiLAN security. It describes the encrypted
     transmission of data between systems 802.11X WiLANs. It also defines new
     encryption key protocols including the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
     (TKIP). The IEEE 802.11i draft standard, version 4, completed Jun. 6,
     2003, is incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0058]The 802.11i is based on 802.1x port-based authentication for user
     and device authentication. The 802.11i standard includes two main
     developments: Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Robust Security Network
     (RSN).
<BR><BR>[0059]WPA uses the same RC4 underlying encryption algorithm as WEP.
     However, WPA uses TKIP to improve security of keys used with WEP. WPA
     keys are derived and rotated more often than WEP keys and thus provide
     additional security. WPA also adds a message-integrity-check function to
     prevent packet forgeries.
<BR><BR>[0060]RSN uses dynamic negotiation of authentication and selectable
     encryption algorithms between wireless access points and wireless
     devices. The authentication schemes proposed in the draft standard
     include Extensible <B><I>Authentication Protocol</I></B> (EAP). One proposed encryption
     algorithm is an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm.
<BR><BR>[0061]Dynamic negotiation of authentication and encryption algorithms lets
     RSN evolve with the state of the art in security, adding algorithms to
     address new threats and continuing to provide the security necessary to
     protect information that WiLANs carry.
<BR><BR>[0062]The NIST developed a new encryption standard, the Advanced
     Encryption Standard (AES) to keep government information secure. AES is
     intended to be a stronger, more efficient successor to Triple Data
     Encryption Standard (3DES). More information on NIST AES can be found at
     the URL "www.nist.gov/aes."
<BR><BR>[0063]As is known in the art, DES is a popular symmetric-key encryption
     method developed in 1975 and standardized by ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92,
     the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. As is known
     in the art, 3DES is the encrypt-decrypt-encrypt (EDE) mode of the DES
     cipher algorithm. 3DES is defined in the ANSI standard, ANSI X9.52-1998,
     the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. DES modes of
     operation are used in conjunction with the NIST Federal Information
     Processing Standard (FIPS) for data encryption (FIPS 46-3, October 1999),
     the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0064]The NIST approved a FIPS for the AES, FIPS-197. This standard
     specified "Rijndael" encryption as a FIPS-approved symmetric encryption
     algorithm that may be used by U.S. Government organizations (and others)
     to protect sensitive information. The NIST FIPS-197 standard (AES FIPS
     PUB 197, November 2001) is incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0065]The NIST approved a FIPS for U.S. Federal Government requirements
     for information technology products for sensitive but unclassified (SBU)
     communications. The NIST FIPS Security Requirements for Cryptographic
     Modules (FIPS PUB 140-2, May 2001) is incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0066]As is known in the art, RSA is a public key encryption system which
     can be used both for encrypting messages and making digital signatures.
     The letters RSA stand for the names of the inventors: Rivest, Shamir and
     Adleman. For more information on RSA, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,829, now
     expired, incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0067]As is known in the art, "hashing" is the transformation of a string
     of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that
     represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve
     items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the
     shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value. It is also
     used in many encryption algorithms.
<BR><BR>[0068]Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), is used for computing a secure
     condensed representation of a data message or a data file. When a message
     of any length &lt;2.sup.64 bits is input, the SHA-1 produces a 160-bit
     output called a "message digest." The message digest can then be input to
     other security techniques such as encryption, a Digital Signature
     Algorithm (DSA) and others which generates or verifies a security
     mechanism for the message. SHA-512 outputs a 512-bit message digest. The
     Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180-1, Apr. 17, 1995, is incorporated
     herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0069]Message Digest-5 (MD-5) takes as input a message of arbitrary length
     and produces as output a 128-bit "message digest" of the input. The MD5
     algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a large
     file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being encrypted with
     a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA. The
     IETF RFC-1321, entitled "The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" is
     incorporated here by reference.
<BR><BR>[0070]As is known in the art, providing a way to check the integrity of
     information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable medium such as a
     wireless network is a prime necessity in the world of open computing and
     communications. Mechanisms that provide such integrity check based on a
     secret key are called "message authentication codes" (MAC). Typically,
     message authentication codes are used between two parties that share a
     secret key in order to validate information transmitted between these
     parties.
<BR><BR>[0071]Keyed Hashing for Message Authentication Codes (HMAC), is a
     mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions.
     HMAC is used with any iterative cryptographic hash function, e.g., MD5,
     SHA-1, SHA-512, etc. in combination with a secret shared key. The
     cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the properties of the
     underlying hash function. The IETF RFC-2101, entitled "HMAC:
     Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication" is incorporated here by
     reference.
<BR><BR>[0072]As is known in the art, an Electronic Code Book (ECB) is a mode of
     operation for a "block cipher," with the characteristic that each
     possible block of plaintext has a defined corresponding cipher text value
     and vice versa. In other words, the same plaintext value will always
     result in the same cipher text value. Electronic Code Book is used when a
     volume of plaintext is separated into several blocks of data, each of
     which is then encrypted independently of other blocks. The Electronic
     Code Book has the ability to support a separate encryption key for each
     block type.
<BR><BR>[0073]As is known in the art, Diffie and Hellman (DH) describe several
     different group methods for two parties to agree upon a shared secret in
     such a way that the secret will be unavailable to eavesdroppers. This
     secret is then converted into various types of cryptographic keys. A
     large number of the variants of the DH method exist including ANSI X9.42.
     The IETF RFC-2631, entitled "Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method" is
     incorporated here by reference.
<BR><BR>[0074]However, the present invention is not limited to the security or
     encryption techniques described and other security or encryption
     techniques can also be used.
<BR><BR>[0075]As is known in the art, IP is an addressing protocol designed to
     route traffic within a network or between networks. For more information
     on IP see IETF RFC-791 incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0076]TCP provides a connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol
     designed to fit into a layered hierarchy of protocols that support
     multi-network applications. For more information on TCP see RFC-793,
     incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0077]UDP provides a connectionless mode of communications with datagrams
     in an interconnected set of networks. For more information on UDP see
     ITEF RFC-768 incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0078]As is known in the art, the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP)
     Secure (HTTPs), is a standard for encrypted communications on the World
     Wide Web. HTTPs is actually just HTTP over a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
     For more information on HTTP, see IETF RFC-2616 incorporated herein by
     reference.
<BR><BR>[0079]As is known in the art, the SSL protocol is a protocol layer which
     may be placed between a reliable connection-oriented network layer
     protocol (e.g. TCP/IP) and the application protocol layer (e.g. HTTP).
     SSL provides for secure communication between a source and destination by
     allowing mutual authentication, the use of digital signatures for
     integrity, and encryption for privacy.
<BR><BR>[0080]The SSL protocol is designed to support a range of choices for
     specific security methods used for cryptography, message digests, and
     digital signatures. The security method are negotiated between the source
     and destination at the start of establishing a protocol session. The SSL
     2.0 protocol specification, by Kipp E. B. Hickman, 1995 is incorporated
     herein by reference. More information on SSL is available at the URL See
     "netscape.com/eng/security/SSL.sub.--2.html."
<BR><BR>[0081]As is known in the art, Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides
     communications privacy over the Internet. The protocol allows
     client/server applications to communicate over a transport layer (e.g.,
     TCP) in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or
     message forgery. For more information on TLS see IETF RFC-2246,
     incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0082]In one embodiment, the security functionality includes Cisco
     Compatible EXtensions (CCX). CCX includes security specifications for
     makers of 802.11xx wireless LAN chips for ensuring compliance with
     Cisco's proprietary wireless security LAN protocols. As is known in the
     art, Cisco Systems, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. is supplier of networking
     hardware and software, including router and security products.
<BR><BR>Passive Voice Enabled RFID Network Device
<BR><BR>[0083]FIG. 2 is a block diagram 30 illustrating a passive voice enabled
     RFID network device 32. The device 32 is a transceiver and includes a
     radio frequency (RF) antenna 34, a signal demodulator 36, a voice decoder
     38, a signal modulator 40, an optional voice encoder 42, non-volatile
     storage 44, a power generating circuit 46, an optional security module 48
     and an optional battery 50. Optional onboard sensors 51 may also be
     included in the device 32. However, the present invention is not limited
     to these components, and more fewer or other components can also be used
     to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0084]The power generating circuit 46 includes a power harvesting circuit
     that provides power to the device by harvesting energy from natural or
     artificial energy sources received on the RF antenna 34. The power
     harvesting circuit 34 provides power to the device without the need for
     an internal power source. A voice identification application stored in
     the non-volatile storage 44 is used to uniquely identify an entity
     producing the voice signals received on the RF antenna 34.
<BR><BR>[0085]As is known in the art, human voice information consists of sounds
     made by a human being using human vocal folds. The vocal folds, in
     combination with articulators, are capable of producing highly intricate
     arrays of sounds.
<BR><BR>[0086]A "voice frequency (VF)" or "voice band" is one of the frequencies,
     within part of the audio range that is used for the transmission of human
     speech. In telephony, the typical usable voice frequency band ranges from
     approximately 300 Hz to 3400 Hz.
<BR><BR>[0087]It is for this reason that the ultra low frequency band of the
     electromagnetic spectrum between 300 and 3000 Hz is also referred to as
     voice frequency (despite the fact that this is electromagnetic energy,
     not acoustic energy). The bandwidth allocated for a single
     voice-frequency transmission channel is usually 4 kHz, including guard
     bands, allowing a sampling rate of 8 kHz to be used as the basis of the
     pulse code modulation (PCM) and other modulation schemes used on voice
     coders/decoders (codecs) for the PSTN and other voice networks including
     Voice-over-Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
<BR><BR>[0088]As is known in the art, VoIP is a set of facilities for managing the
     delivery of voice information using IP packets. In general, VoIP is used
     to send voice information in digital form in discrete data packets (i.e.,
     IP packets) over data networks rather than using traditional
     circuit-switched protocols used on the PSTN. VoIP is used on both
     wireless and wired data networks.
<BR><BR>[0089]VoIP typically comprises several applications (e.g., Session
     Initiation Protocol (SIP), Service Location Protocol (SLP), H.323, H.324,
     Domain Name System (DNS), Authentication Authorization and Accounting
     (AAA), codecs (G.7xx), etc.) that convert a voice signal into a stream of
     packets (e.g., IP packets) on a packet network and back again. VoIP
     allows voice signals to travel over a stream of data packets over a
     communications network.
<BR><BR>[0090]The voice speech of a typical adult male has fundamental frequency
     of from 85 to 155 Hz, and that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255
     Hz. Thus, the fundamental frequency of most human speech falls below the
     bottom of the "voice frequency" band as defined above. However, due the
     characteristics of the voice signals, enough of a harmonic series is
     present in the missing voice signal fundamentals to recreate the
     fundamental tones of human male and female speech for use in telephony.
<BR><BR>[0091]Voice information also includes sound information generated by
     non-humans such as animals, and sound information generated artificially
     by electronically circuitry. As is known in the art, sound is vibrational
     energy transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas.
<BR><BR>[0092]In one embodiment, the passive voice enabled RFID network device 32
     is a passive voice enabled RFID tag. In another embodiment, the passive
     voice enabled RFID network device 32 is a passive voice enable RFID
     sensor. In another embodiment, the passive voice enable RFID network
     device 32 is a passive voice enabled RFID biometric tag.
<BR><BR>[0093]As is known in the art, an "RFID tag" is an object that can be
     applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the
     purpose of identification and/or tracking using RF signals.
<BR><BR>[0094]As is known in the art, an "RFID sensor" is a device that measures a
     physical quantity and converts it into an RF signal which can be read by
     an observer or by an instrument (e.g., RFID controller/RFID portal 26,
     etc.)
<BR><BR>[0095]As is known in the art, a "biometric" is method for uniquely
     recognizing humans or non-human entities based upon one or more intrinsic
     physical or behavioral traits. Thus, an RFID biometric tag is an object
     that can be applied to or incorporated on or into a human or animal for
     the purpose of identification.
<BR><BR>[0096]There are generally two types of RFID devices: active RFID devices,
     which include a battery, and passive RFID devices, which have no battery.
     The device 32 is a passive RFID device and does not require a power
     source such as a battery.
<BR><BR>[0097]In one embodiment, the radio frequency (RF) antenna 34 includes a
     WPAN wireless personal area network (WPAN) interface antenna. As is known
     in the art, a WPAN is a personal area network for interconnecting devices
     centered around an individual person's devices in which the connections
     are wireless. A WPAN interconnects all the ordinary computing and
     communicating devices that a person has on their desk (e.g. computer,
     etc.) or carry with them (e.g., PDA, mobile phone, two-way pager, etc.).
     However, the present invention is not limited to a WPAN antenna and other
     RF antennas can also be used to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0098]Typically, a wireless personal area network uses some technology
     that permits communication only within about ten meters. One such
     technology is "Bluetooth." Another such technology is "Zigbee."
<BR><BR>[0099]A key concept in WPAN technology is known as "plugging in." In the
     ideal scenario, when any two WPAN-equipped devices come into close
     proximity (within several meters of each other) or within a few
     kilometers of a central server (not illustrated), they can communicate
     via wireless communications as if connected by a cable. WPAN devices can
     also lock out other devices selectively, preventing needless interference
     or unauthorized access to secure information.
<BR><BR>[0100]In one embodiment of the present invention, the RF antenna 34
     accepts wireless signals, including, but are not limited to, IEEE
     802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.15.4 (ZigBee), 802.16a, 802.16g,
     "Wireless Fidelity" (Wi-Fi), "Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave
     Access" (WiMAX), ETSI High Performance Radio Metropolitan Area Network
     (HIPERMAN) "RF Home," Bluetooth or other types of wireless signals.
     However, the present invention is not limited to such RF antennas and
     other types of RF antennas can also be used.
<BR><BR>[0101]In another embodiment of the present invention, the RF antenna 34
     includes a wireless sensor device that comprises an integral or separate
     Bluetooth and/or infra data association (IrDA) module for wireless
     Bluetooth or wireless infrared communications.
<BR><BR>[0102]In one embodiment, the RF antenna 34 includes a baseband
     transceiver. As is known in the art, a "baseband" transceiver is a
     transceiver in which information is carried in digital form in one or
     more channels on a transmission medium. A baseband includes any frequency
     band on which information is superimposed, whether or not a frequency
     band is multiplexed and on which digital information can be sent on
     sub-bands.
<BR><BR>[0103]In one embodiment, signal demodulator 36 and signal modulator 40
     includes Complementary Code Keying (CCK). As is known in the art, CCK is
     a modulation scheme used with wireless networks (WLANs) that employ the
     IEEE 802.11b specification. A complementary code includes a pair of
     finite bit sequences of equal length, such that a number of pairs of
     identical elements (e.g., one or zero) with any given separation in one
     sequence are equal to a number of pairs of unlike elements having the
     same separation in the other sequence.
<BR><BR>[0104]In one embodiment, signal demodulator 36 and signal modulator 40
     includes differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK). DQPSK
     modulates using differential quaternary phase shift keying. The output is
     a baseband representation of the modulated signal.
<BR><BR>[0105]In one embodiment signal demodulator 36 and signal modulator 40
     includes differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK). DBPSK modulates
     using the differential binary phase shift keying. The output is a
     baseband representation of the modulated signal.
<BR><BR>[0106]In one embodiment, signal demodulator 36 and signal modulator 40
     includes Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM is also
     called discrete multi-tone modulation (DMT) and is a transmission
     technique based upon the idea of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)
     where multiple signals are sent out at different frequencies. OFDM uses a
     composite of narrow channel bands to enhance its performance in high
     frequency bands (such as 5.x GHz) in urban and rural applications where
     building clutter and foliage can negatively impact the propagation of
     radio waves for wireless devices.
<BR><BR>[0107]In one embodiment, signal demodulator 36 and signal modulator 40
     includes Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA).
     CSMA/CA is a data-link layer protocol used in the data-link chip for
     carrier transmission in 802.11xx networks. CSMA/CA acts to prevent
     collisions before they happen.
<BR><BR>[0108]However, other signal modulators and signal demodulators could also
     be used and the present invention is not limited to such signal
     modulators/demodulators.
<BR><BR>[0109]In one embodiment, the audio codecs used in the voice decoder 38,
     and optional voice encoder 42 are compliant ITU-T G.711, G.722, G.723,
     G.728 and G.729 standards, the contents of which are incorporated herein
     by reference. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) codecs can
     also be used.
<BR><BR>[0110]As is known in the art, GSM is a digital cellular telephone
     technology widely used throughout Europe, in Australia, India, Africa,
     Asia, and the Middle East, and growing in use in the United States. The
     ITU-T GSM codec standards are incorporated herein by reference. However,
     other audio codecs could also be used and the present invention is not
     limited to such audio codecs.
<BR><BR>[0111]The non-volatile storage 44 includes non-volatile memory such as
     flash memory, EEPROM, etc. However, the device 32 is not limited to such
     non-volatile storage and other types of non-volatile storage can also be
     used to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0112]A voice identification application stored in the non-volatile
     storage 44 uniquely identifies a human entity or non-human entity
     producing the voice signals received on the RF antenna 34. The passive
     voice enabled RFID network device 32 provides "speaker recognition" based
     on voice information or other sound information decoded by the voice
     decoder codec 38. "Speaker recognition" is a validating a speaker's
     claimed identity using characteristics extracted from the speaker's
     voice.
<BR><BR>[0113]There is a difference between "speaker recognition " (i.e.,
     recognizing who is speaking) and "speech recognition " (i.e., recognizing
     what is being said). These two terms are frequently confused, as is
     "voice recognition."
<BR><BR>[0114]"Voice recognition" is a synonym for "speaker recognition," and thus
     is not speech recognition. However, in another embodiment, the device 32
     also can be programmed to perform speech recognition by storing and
     executing the appropriate applications and identification information in
     non-volatile storage 44.
<BR><BR>[0115]In another embodiment of the invention, the "speaker recognition"
     includes sound recognition of animal sounds, and other unique artificial
     sounds that be generated by electronic circuitry.
<BR><BR>[0116]The power generating circuit 42 includes a power harvesting circuit
     that converts artificial or natural energy sources to voltage and current
     to power the device 32 with Direct Current (DC) power. In another
     embodiment, the device is powered with analog current (AC) power provided
     by the power harvesting circuit. The artificial or natural energy sources
     include (but are not limited to) kinetic, thermal, gravitational, sound,
     light, chemical, nuclear and electromagnetic energy.
<BR><BR>[0117]As is known in the art, kinetic energy is the energy due to the
     movement of an object. Thermal energy is energy derived from heat.
     Gravitational energy is energy derived from gravity. Sound energy is an
     energetic vibration transmitted through a solid, liquid, or gas. Light
     energy or visible light, is electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength
     that is visible to the human eye (about 400-700 nm), or up to 380-750 nm.
     In the broader field of physics, light is used to refer to
     electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths, whether visible or not.
     Chemical energy is a net potential energy liberated or absorbed during
     the course of a chemical reaction. Nuclear energy is energy produced
     during a nuclear reaction.
<BR><BR>[0118]As is known in the art, electromagnetic energy has an electric and
     magnetic field component which oscillate in phase perpendicular to each
     other and to the direction of energy propagation. Electromagnetic
     radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of the
     wave, these types include, for example, radio waves, microwaves,
     terahertz radiation, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet
     radiation, X-rays, gamma rays, etc.
<BR><BR>Power Generating Circuit 42
<BR><BR>[0119]One objective of the power generating circuit 42 is to produce
     enough direct current (DC) power to power at least a 16-bit (or larger)
     microcontroller and interact with external RFID sensors, RFID tags, other
     external sensors through a single RF antenna 34. Power requirements in
     the power generating circuit 42 are calculated from a "link budget." The
     "link budget" is an amount of power that the device 32 needs to send and
     receive RF data across a RF wireless link in order that transmitted RF
     data can be successfully sent to and received on a RFID controller/RFID
     portal 26.
<BR><BR>[0120]FIG. 3 is a block diagram 52 illustrating additional details of a
     power generating circuit 42. The power generating circuit 42 includes an
     impedance matching circuit 54, a power harvester circuit 56, a voltage
     regulator 58, a fully programmable 16-bit microcontroller (MCU) 60 with
     flash memory and one or more high-resolution analog-to-digital (ADC)
     converters 62. The ADC may be connected to one or more external sensors,
     such as biological, kinetic, thermal, gravitational, sound, light, etc.
<BR><BR>[0121]However, the present invention is not limited to this configuration
     and more, fewer or other components can also be used in the power
     generating circuit 42 to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0122]The antenna 34 is connected to the impedance matching circuit 54. As
     is known in the art, electrical impedance, or simply impedance, describes
     a measure of opposition to a sinusoidal alternating current (AC).
     Electrical impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits,
     describing not only the relative amplitudes of the voltage and current,
     but also the relative phases.
<BR><BR>[0123]The power harvester 56 rectifies incoming RF energy as AC signals
     into DC voltage to power the device 32. The demodulator 36 follows an
     envelope of an RF carrier wave to extract an incoming modulated data
     stream. This extracted base band waveform is read by the MCU 60 to
     receive downlink RF data from the reader. For uplink RF data, it is sent
     via the signal modulator 40, which functions by changing the antenna
     impedance. Any onboard sensors 51 or connection to external sensors are
     powered and measured by the MCU 60. For example, the onboard sensors
     and/or external sensors may include biological agent sensors (e.g.,
     anthrax, etc.) or sensors for kinetic, thermal, gravitational, sound,
     light, chemical, nuclear or electromagnetic energy.
<BR><BR>[0124]In order to calculate a link budget, the following parameters are
     considered: (1) How much RF power can the RFID controller/portal 26
     transmit? (2) How much power does the device 32 receive relevant to the
     distance from a RFID controller/portal 26? (3) How much power does the
     device 32 need to turn on its pre-determined hardware capability? (4) How
     much power does the device 32 need for modulation and demodulation? And
     (5) How much power does the device need for voice decoding and/or
     optionally voice encoding? However, the present invention is not limited
     to these parameters and the link budget can also be calculated with more
     or fewer parameters.
<BR><BR>[0125]In order to calculate a link budget between the RFID controller/RFID
     portal 26 and the device 32, three parameters are used: (1) transmit
     power; (2) path loss; and (3) power required at the received antenna on
     the RFID controller/RFID portal 26. However, the present invention is not
     limited to these parameters and more, fewer or other parameters can also
     be used to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0126]In general, finding the "path loss" requires knowing the details of
     the RF antenna 34 operation. An omni-directional RF antenna is used that
     radiates essentially a non-directional pattern in an azimuth and a
     directional pattern in elevation plane.
<BR><BR>[0127]However, the present invention is not limited to such an antenna and
     other types of directive antenna and/or multiple-input and
     multiple-output (MIMO) approaches can also be used to practice the
     invention.
<BR><BR>[0128]Using an omni-directional antenna, a power density at a distance (d)
     is a ratio of the transmitted power P.sub.TX to a sphere area. The power
     delivered to a received antenna P.sub.RX can be determined as is
     illustrated in Equation (1):
<BR><BR>P.sub.RX=P.sub.TX(effective aperture of the received
     antenna)/4.PI.d.sup.2.times.Antenna Gain   (1)
<BR><BR>wherein, the equation in Equation (1) is known as the Friis Transmission
     Equation.
<BR><BR>[0129]Assuming a maximum transmitting power that is one Watt (W) allowed
     by U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the path loss between
     900 MHz antennas with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) considered is
     estimated using Equation (2):
<BR><BR>10 log(1W/1 mW)-10 log(P.sub.RX).apprxeq.30 dBm-(-1.6 dBm).apprxeq.32 dB
     (2)
<BR><BR>However, the present invention is not limited to these calculations or a
     one Watt maximum and other parameters can be used to practice the
     invention.
<BR><BR>[0130]This maximizes the received power (&gt;0.7 mW or -1.6 dBm) in order
     to turn on the power harvester circuit 42 in a receiver located from
     afar-field of the transmitting antenna 34.
<BR><BR>[0131]In one specific exemplary embodiment, this design is sufficient to
     harvest enough power to run a battery-free voice enabled RFID device 32
     using a 16-bit RISC microcontroller MCU 60, designated as MSP430, from
     Texas Instruments. Its peripherals and flexible clock system are combined
     by using a Von-Neumann common memory address bus (MAB) and memory data
     bus (MDB) partnering a modern CPU with modular memory-mapped analog and
     digital peripherals.
<BR><BR>[0132]One reason for choosing a device such as the MSP430 for this
     specific exemplary design is because it was designed specifically for
     ultra-low-power applications. However, the present invention is not
     limited to the devices described and other devices can also be used to
     practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0133]A flexible clocking system, multiple operating modes and zero-power
     always on brownout reset (BOR) are implemented to reduce power
     consumption. The MSP430 BOR function is always active, even in all
     low-power modes to ensure the most reliable performance possible. The CPU
     has multiple operating modes at the power consumptions illustrated in
     Table 1.

<BR><BR>[0134]In other words, the power harvesting circuit 42 is designed to
     support a minimum 1.8-V to power a voice enable RFID device 32 embedded
     with 16-bit microprocessor, flash memory, modulation and demodulation
     circuits 36, 40, voice decoder circuits 38 optional voice encoder 42 and
     external sensors such as used for biological agents, kinetic, thermal,
     gravitational, sound, light, chemical, nuclear and electromagnetic
     energy.
<BR><BR>[0135]FIG. 4 is a block diagram 64 illustrating additional details of the
     power harvester circuit 56 used in the exemplary power generating circuit
     42.
<BR><BR>[0136]The power harvester circuit 56 includes an N-level charge pump 66
     with a pre-determined number of diodes and capacitors configured in a
     pre-determined configuration.
<BR><BR>[0137]In one specific exemplary embodiment the N-level charge pump 66
     includes four levels, eight diodes and eight capacitors. However, the
     present invention is not limited to this embodiment and more or fewer
     levels, diodes and capacitors can also be used to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0138]The charge pump 66 illustrated in FIG. 4 includes four levels with a
     pre-determined number of diodes 68 connected on layers in series so that
     a resulting output voltage is increased. A "voltage doubler" circuit is
     shown in each level. Sets of two diodes 68 are connected in series and
     oriented so that forward current flows from a ground potential to a
     positive terminal of an output voltage regulator 58. One or more
     capacitors 70 are connected in parallel with the diode in each layer
     stores a resulting charge to smooth the output voltage. A capacitor 72
     nearest the antenna 34 prevents DC current from flowing between the
     antenna 34 and the diodes 68, but store charges and thus, permits high
     frequency current to flow.
<BR><BR>[0139]When a RF input is negative and larger than the turn-on voltage, the
     first diode is on. Current flows from the ground through the diode,
     causing charge to accumulate on the input capacitor. At the negative
     peak, a voltage across the capacitor is the difference between the
     negative peak voltage and the voltage on the top of the diode.
<BR><BR>[0140]When the RF input becomes positive, the first diode turns off and
     the second (output) diode turns on. The charge that was collected on the
     input capacitor travels through the output diode to the output capacitor.
     The peak voltage that can be achieved is double the result of the peak
     positive RF voltage subtracting the turn on voltage of the output diode.
<BR><BR>[0141]Additional levels can also be added to the charge pump circuit 66.
     However, limitations exist on how many additional levels could be added
     to the charge pump circuit 66 to convert more DC power due to decreasing
     power-efficiency when extra turn-on voltage of the diodes is required.
     Hence, the power-efficiency vs. number of charge pump layers is one of
     the design considerations of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0142]Another design consideration before implementing the charge pump
     circuit 66 is to select an antenna and associated matching structures as
     needed to provide as high an output voltage as possible from a given
     incident electric field. A trade-off is also made between the use of
     circularly polarized antenna, sacrificing range, or the use of
     polarization-diverse antenna and adding cost and size to the antenna
     structure.
<BR><BR>[0143]In one exemplary embodiment, a voltage charge pump circuitry 66 at
     the far-field is used to produce a minimum 1.8-V DC from UHF (900 MHz
     range) and 2.4 GHz RF energy sources. Equation (1) and (2) are used to
     derive the desired accuracy for the circuitry 66 based on these
     parameters. However, the present invention is not limited to these
     parameters and other parameters can also be used to practice the
     invention.
<BR><BR>[0144]Unlike a common RFID approach, which harvests minimum power to turn
     on an IC chip, the device 32 operates at the far-field from a
     transmitting antenna and utilizes a multi layer charge pump circuit 66 to
     convert more DC power to operate a fully programmable microcontroller
     with flash memory and high-resolution analog-to-digital converters. The
     microcontroller firmware also implements portions of the Electronic
     Product Code (EPC) Class 1 Generation 1 protocol.
<BR><BR>[0145]When queried, the device 32 communicates arbitrary sensor data by
     emulating an EPC tag within a transducer electronic data sheet (TEDS) to
     encode the desired sensor data. A required CRC (e.g., 16-bit CRC) is
     computed dynamically by the microcontroller 60. The device 23, which is a
     RF transmitter and functions equivalent to RFID reader, reports the
     received tag ID from IEEE 1451 TEDS to application software stored in
     non-volatile storage 44, 60, which can interpret the information included
     in the TEDS.
<BR><BR>[0146]The programmability of the device 32 along with its implementation
     as a PCB allows for flexible integration of arbitrary low-power sensors.
     Furthermore, such passive voice enable RFID sensors 32 are also
     exclusively powered from the power harvester 56 resulting in a completely
     battery free device. The device 32 is a fully programmable and can
     operate using power transmitted from long-range UHF and/or 2.4 GHz
     devices and communicate arbitrary, multi-bit data in a single response
     packet
<BR><BR>[0147]Additionally, energies from one or more of the following: (1) RF ISM
     band at 5 GHz, (2) vibrational energy; (3) RF noise sources near device
     32; (4) animal sounds; and (5) repeating RF signals, are added into pump
     circuitry 66 using Equations (1) and (2). Thus, the device can be
     additional powered from these additional energy sources picked up on the
     antenna 34.
<BR><BR>[0148]In one specific exemplary embodiment, the power harvesting circuit
     56 is configured specifically for harvesting energy from license free ISM
     bands: 900 MHz to 2.4 GHz radio waves generated from the RFID
     controller/RFID portal 26 and for scavenged electromagnetic energy,
     vibrations and RF noise from open-air sources and provide the capability
     to harvest energy from nearby RF energy source in open air between 800
     MHz to 2.4 GHz without depending on a RFID controller/RFID portal 26 to
     transmit any RF energy whatsoever to the device. However, the present
     invention is not limited to this configuration and other configurations
     using other energy sources can also be used to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0149]Equation (1) teaches that the radiation power received at the device
     32 is proportional to an effective aperture of the antenna 34 in relation
     to its efficiency and directive gain. Therefore, an advanced antenna beam
     forming technique (e.g., MIMO, etc.) is used to achieve a high-degree of
     DC power conversion.
<BR><BR>[0150]As a result of the power generating circuit 42, the device 32 does
     not require a battery. It includes a passive voice capable RFID network
     device with a power harvesting circuit that is powered by harvesting
     energy from various artificial or energy sources and/or natural energy
     sources such as: voice signals, other electromagnetic waves, sun light,
     vibrations, RF noise, etc.
<BR><BR>[0151]FIG. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a Method 74 for using a
     passive voice enabled RFID voice network device. At Step 50, voice
     information is received on a passive voice enabled RFID network device.
     The voice information is used to power the device via a power harvesting
     circuit and to uniquely identify a pre-determined entity sending the
     voice information. At Step 52, the voice information is processed on the
     passive voice enabled RFID network device via the voice decoder. At Step
     54, the processed voice information is also used to identify a
     pre-determined entity. The entity may be a human or a non-human capable
     of producing voice information or other distinct sounds or signals.
     Information about the pre-determined entity is stored in the non-volatile
     memory.
<BR><BR>[0152]Method 74 is illustrated with an exemplary embodiment. However, the
     present invention is not limited to this exemplary embodiment and other
     embodiments may be use to practice the invention.
<BR><BR>[0153]In such a specific exemplary embodiment at Step 50, voice
     information is received on a passive voice enabled RFID network device
     32. The voice information is used to generate power in a power generating
     circuit 42 and is used to identify a pre-determined entity sending the
     voice information. Other types of natural and artificial energy is also
     used by the power generating circuit 42 to power the device 32.
<BR><BR>[0154]At Step 52, the voice information is processed on the passive RFID
     tag via a voice decoder 38. In one embodiment, the processing includes
     comparing the processed voice information to voice information storage in
     non-volatile memory 44 or flash in MCU 60.
<BR><BR>[0155]At Step 54, the processed voice information is also used to identify
     a pre-determined entity. In one embodiment, the device 32 is a voice
     enabled RFID tag used as a voice activated personal identification tag, a
     voice activated personal communicator, etc. Therefore, it provides the
     capabilities for voice-based identification, voice-based tracking, and
     voice-based communications.
<BR><BR>[0156]FIG. 6 is a block diagram 82 of an exemplary communications network
     using passive voice enabled RFID network devices 32.
<BR><BR>[0157]In one embodiment, one or more voice and/sound identities of human
     84 and non-human 86, 88 (e.g., animals, goods, etc.) are stored in the
     non-volatile storage 44, 60 on the device 32 to positively identify the
     human or non-human entity based on voice information or other sound
     information characteristics. In such an embodiment, the device is
     attached directly to the human 84 or non-human entity 86, 88.
     Communication is to/from the device 32 and/or to/from the RFID
     controller/RFID portal 26.
<BR><BR>[0158]In the case of non-human entities such as animals 86, the voice
     information characteristics include sounds such as barking, growling,
     chirping, etc. The non-human entities can also includes packages 88 etc.,
     with devices that generate a unique sound (or RF signal) that can be
     processed by voice decoder 38 and identified on the device 32.
<BR><BR>[0159]In another embodiment, the device 32 may be attached to something
     (e.g., a wall, door, etc.) near the RFID controller/RFID portal 26. In
     such an embodiment, the human 90 (or animal or inanimate object such as a
     package, etc.) would speak (or broadcast, etc.) a pre-determined voice
     command (e.g., a sentence, phrase, name, etc.) to the device 32 and the
     device 32 would uniquely identify the human 90 to and between the RFID
     controller/RFID portal 26.
<BR><BR>[0160]In another embodiment, the device 32 is an active RFID device that
     includes an optional battery 50 (or other DC power source).
<BR><BR>[0161]In another embodiment, the device 32 includes a security module 48
     using one or more of the security features described above for secure
     communications. The security module 48 can be used on the device 32 if
     the device 32 uses the power generating circuit 42 and/or the battery 50.
<BR><BR>[0162]The device 32 may be used for unique identity identification via
     voice, biometrics, supply chain management, medical, for Data,
     Information and Knowledge (DIaK) sensors and sensor tracking extended
     services such as those used as part of capabilities offered by Integrated
     Systems Health Management (ISHM) and for other applications.
<BR><BR>[0163]The architecture of a passively powered voice enabled RFID network
     device 32 brings a rich set of state-of the-art capabilities to support
     ISHM systems for sensing, processing, control, and distribution. Such
     devices 32 enable a mesh network, a mesh sensor network or other sensor
     network to significantly to increase capabilities for improved
     identification and tracking, data sharing, information dissemination,
     online data processing, automated feature extraction, data fusion, and
     parallel and distributed computing functions.
