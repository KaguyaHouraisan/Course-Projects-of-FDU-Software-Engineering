<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>A method of securing communications in an <B><I>RFID</I></B> system including a reader
     and an RF tag having a memory configured to store information comprises
     sending, from the reader, a message to the tag; the tag, in response to
     the message, generating a challenge value and sending the challenge value
     to the reader; in any order: the reader performing a mathematical
     operation on the challenge value based upon a key value to generate a
     challenge reply and sending the challenge reply to the tag and the tag
     independently computing a challenge response based on the key value and
     mathematical operation; the tag comparing the challenge response computed
     by the tag with the challenge reply sent by the reader; and the tag
     authenticating the reader if the challenge response matches the challenge
     reply. An <B><I>RFID</I></B> system including an <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag and a reader are configured to
     perform the above steps.

<BR><BR>The invention relates to a remote communication system.  More particularly, the invention relates to a radio frequency (RF) identification system and methods for secure communications between a RFID reader and RFID tags.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Remote communication utilizing wireless equipment typically relies on radio frequency (RF) technology, which is employed in many industries.  One application of RF technology is in locating, identifying, and tracking objects, such as animals,
inventory, and vehicles.
<BR><BR>RF identification (RFID) tag systems have been developed to identify, monitor or control remote objects.  As shown in FIG. 1, a basic RFID system 10 includes an interrogator 18 and transponders (commonly called RF tags) 16.  The interrogator 18
includes a transceiver with decoder 14 and an antenna 12.  The tag 16 includes an antenna 24.  In operation, the antenna 12 emits and receives electromagnetic radio signals generated by the transceiver 14 to activate the tag 16 and receive signals from
the tag.  When the tag 16 is activated, data can be read from or written to the tag.
<BR><BR>In some applications, the transceiver and antenna 12 are components of an interrogator (or reader) 18, which can be configured either as a hand-held or a fixed-mount device.  The interrogator 18 emits the radio signals 20 in range from one inch
to one hundred feet or more, depending upon its power output and the radio frequency used.  When an RF tag 16 passes through the electromagnetic radio waves 20, the tag detects the signal 20 and is activated.  Data encoded in the tag 16 is then
transmitted by a modulated data signal 22 through an antenna 24 to the interrogator 18 for subsequent processing.
<BR><BR>An advantage of RFID systems is the non-contact, non-line-of-sight capability of the technology.  Tags can be read through a variety of substances such as snow, fog, ice, paint, dirt, and other visually and environmentally challenging conditions
where bar codes or other optically-read technologies would be useless.  RF tags can also be read at remarkable speeds, in most cases responding in less than one hundred milliseconds.
<BR><BR>There are three main categories of RFID tag systems.  These are systems that employ beam-powered passive tags, battery-powered semi-passive tags, and active tags.  Each operates in fundamentally different ways.  The invention described below in
the Detailed Description can be embodied in any of these types of systems.
<BR><BR>The beam-powered RFID tag is often referred to as a passive device because it derives the energy needed for its operation from the radio frequency energy beamed at it.  The tag rectifies the field and changes the reflective characteristics of the
tag itself, creating a change in reflectivity that is seen at the interrogator.  A battery-powered semi-passive RFID tag operates in a similar fashion, modulating its RF cross-section in order to change its reflectivity that is seen at the interrogator
to develop a communication link.  Here, the battery is the only source of the tag's operational power.  Finally, in the active RFID tag, both the tag and reader have transceivers to communicate and are powered by a battery.
<BR><BR>A typical RF tag system 10 will contain at least one tag 16 and one interrogator 18.  The range of communication for such tags varies according to the transmission power of the interrogator 18 and the tag 16.  Battery-powered tags operating at
2,450 MHz have traditionally been limited to less than ten meters in range.  However, devices with sufficient power can reach in excess of 100 meters in range, depending on the frequency and environmental characteristics.
<BR><BR>Conventional RF tag systems utilize continuous wave backscatter to communicate data from the tag 16 to the interrogator 18.  More specifically, the interrogator 18 transmits a continuous-wave radio signal to the tag 16, which modulates the signal
20 using modulated backscattering wherein the electrical characteristics of the antenna 24 are altered by a modulating signal from the tag that reflects a modulated signal 22 back to the interrogator 18.  The modulated signal 22 is encoded with
information from the tag 16.  The interrogator 18 then demodulates the modulated signal 22 and decodes the information.
<BR><BR>Conventional continuous wave backscatter RF tag systems utilizing passive (no battery) RF tags require adequate power from the signal 20 to power the internal circuitry in the tag 16 used to modulate the signal back to the interrogator 18.  While
this is successful for tags that are located in close proximity to an interrogator, for example less than three meters, this may be insufficient range for some applications, for example greater than 100 meters.
<BR><BR>A problem in RFID systems is in authentication and secure communications between the reader and RF tags in the field of view of the reader.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>One aspect of the invention provides a method and apparatus for authenticating a reader or tags over a public, open channel.  Another aspect of the invention provides a method and apparatus that is more robust against spoofing and other illicit
access attempts than password-based methods.
<BR><BR>The invention provides a method of securing communications in an RFID system including a reader and an RF tag having a memory configured to store information, the method comprising: sending, from the reader, a message to the tag; the tag, in
response to the message, generating a challenge value and sending the challenge value to the reader; in any order: the reader performing a mathematical operation on the challenge value based upon a key value to generate a challenge reply and sending the
challenge reply to the tag and the tag independently computing a challenge response based on the key value and mathematical operation; the tag comparing the challenge response computed by the tag with the challenge reply send by the reader; and the tag
authenticating the reader if the challenge response matches the challenge reply.
<BR><BR>Another aspect of the invention provides a method of securing communications in an RFID system including a reader and an RF tag having a memory configured to store information, the method comprising: sending, from the tag, a message to the
reader; the reader, in response to the message, generating a challenge value and sending the challenge value to the tag; in any order: the tag performing a mathematical operation on the challenge value based upon a key value to generate a challenge reply

by inventor C. L. Carrender, now U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,738,025; U.S.  patent application Ser.  No. 09/833,391, filed Apr.  11, 2001, entitled "Frequency Hopping RFID Reader", by inventor C. L. Carrender.
<BR><BR>As shown in FIG. 2, an embodiment of the present invention is directed to an RF communication system 30 that employs backscatter signals.  The RF communication system 30 includes a reader or interrogator 32 that includes an antenna 34 through
which the reader can transmit an interrogation signal 36 to an RF tag 44.  The RF tag modulates the continuous wave interrogation signal 36 to produce a backscatter response signal 40 that is transmitted back to the interrogator 32.  The signal 40 can
include an identification code stored in memory 50, or other data.  While FIG. 2 shows only two tags 44, there would typically be multiple tags 44 in use, capable of communicating with the reader 32.
<BR><BR>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the RF tag 44 includes an antenna 42 coupled to a modulator defined by processor 48.  The tag 44 includes a switch coupled between the antenna 42 and processor 48.  In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the switch is
included in the processor 48.  Alternatively, the switch can be a switch external to the processor 48, such as an n-channel MOS transistor, a p-channel MOS transistor, a bi-polar transistor, or any of numerous other types of switches.
<BR><BR>In FIG. 2, a modulating signal from the processor 48 is input to the antenna 42 to cause the antenna to alternately reflect or not reflect.  One item that can be transmitted from the tag to the reader is an identification code that is stored in
memory 50 of the RF tag 44.  In one embodiment, after receiving a command, the reader sends a carrier wave or interrogation signal 36 that is received by the antenna 42, and that signal is selectively reflected or not reflected back by the antenna 42 by
the tag 44 shorting or not shorting dipole halves of the antenna 42 to produce portions of the response signal 40 (backscatter communications).  Other communication methods are possible.
<BR><BR>It will be appreciated that the depiction of the RF tag 44 in FIG. 2 is one embodiment only; RFID tags are well-known in the art.  For example, U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,075,632 to Baldwin et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, discusses in
detail circuit structures that could be used to produce the RF tag 44, if modified as described below.
<BR><BR>Similarly, the internal structures of the interrogator 32 are not shown in FIG. 2.  For example, the interrogator 32 can be the receiver described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 4,360,810 to Landt, which is incorporated herein by reference, modified as
described below.
<BR><BR>In the illustrated embodiment, the reader 32 includes a processor 54, which in turn includes an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 56 and a random number generator 58.  The processor 54 further includes a memory 64; alternatively, the reader 32 includes
a memory separate from the processor 54.  The memory 64 stores a secret key value 68, the use of which will be described in greater detail below.  The memory 50 of each tag 44 also stores a secret key value 66 which, in the illustrated embodiment, is the
same value as the key value 68.
<BR><BR>The processor 54 includes other features typically included in processors of the type typically employed in RFID readers.  In one embodiment, the random number generator 58 actually generates pseudo random numbers; i.e., the numbers generated may
follow a pattern that could be recreated.  While the random number generator 58 is shown as being separate from the ALU 56, in one embodiment, the random number generator 58 is defined in part by the ALU 56.  Similarly, each of the RF tags 44 is shown as
including an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 60 and a random number generator 62.  Depending on whether the tags 44 or the reader 32 will be the authenticator (as will be described below), the random number generator may be omitted from either the RF tags 44
or from the reader 32.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating steps performed by the tag and reader of FIG. 2.  Aspects of the invention that will be described in connection with FIG. 3 can be embodied in methods and apparatus employing tags of varying levels of
sophistication.  Multiple IF frequencies or read-while-write capability are not required.  An advantage is that the amount of communication between the reader and the tags is minimized.  This is useful to increase the speed of discovering the identities
of tags.
<BR><BR>Aspects of the invention described in connection with FIG. 3 also provide authentication (identity verification) over a public, open channel.  This method can be used by the tag to authenticate the reader, or by the reader to authenticate the
tag.
<BR><BR>All participants in the authentication perform long, logical mathematical operations.  More particularly, in step S1, the Requestor device requesting access (can be either a tag or the reader) sends a message to the Authenticator.  In one
embodiment, the Requestor is a tag 44 and the Authenticator is the reader 32.  In another embodiment, the Requestor is the reader 32 and the Authenticator is a tag 44.
<BR><BR>In step S2, the Authenticator generates an "Access Challenge" number.  More particularly, in one embodiment, the "Access Challenge" number is a pseudo random number generated by the random number generator 58 or 62.  Still more particularly, in
one embodiment, the "Access Challenge" value is a long binary value, which is randomly generated.  The length can be 128 bits, 256 bits, 512 bits, or any desired value selected depending on the desired security level versus cost and processing time.
<BR><BR>In step S3, the Authenticator sends the "Access Challenge" number or value to the Requestor.
<BR><BR>In step S4, the Requestor performs a long mathematical operation (or series of mathematical operations) on the "Access Challenge" number based upon the secret key value 66 or 68 (see FIG. 2) to define a "Challenge Response."
<BR><BR>In step S5, the Requestor replies to the Authenticator with a "Challenge Response".
<BR><BR>In step S6, the Authenticator independently computes its own "Challenge Response" by performing the same mathematical operation of step S4 that the Requestor performed and by using the same key value that the Requestor performed.  Step S6 could
be performed after step S1 and before step S2, simultaneously with step S2, or at any time between step S1 and step S7.
<BR><BR>In step S7, the Authenticator compares the received "Challenge Response" from the Requestor matches the value computed by the Authenticator.  If not, the Authenticator denies access in step S8.  If so, the Authenticator grants access in step S9.
<BR><BR>In step S10, the Authenticator sends a message to the Requestor informing the Requestor that access is granted.  After step S10, normal communications occur in step S11, including transmission of information stored in the Authenticator to the
Requestor (e.g., identification information, account information, financial information, etc.).
<BR><BR>This is similar to the approach used in prior hardware based "dongle" designs, which were used in the past to prevent software piracy, except in a completely different field of use and without requiring a traditional dongle.
<BR><BR>The advantages of this approach include:
<BR><BR>(1) The "Access Challenge" number is a generally random number;
<BR><BR>(2) The response to the Access Challenge is dependent upon the Challenge value, but is convoluted to obscure the key value.
<BR><BR>(3) Multiple key values are possible, which can uniquely identify the user.
<BR><BR>(4) The length of the keys and challenge values can be configured to the security requirement at hand.  Tradeoffs can be made between level of security and system cost.  Greater security requires longer keys, longer messages, and more processor
power.
<BR><BR>(5) The approach of FIG. 3 is used to generate <B><I>encryption</I></B> values for a data stream, in an alternative embodiment.  The challenge response is not transmitted, but is used to encrypt the data stream.
<BR><BR>This approach can be implemented in a passive or semi-passive RFID application to provide a level of security and/or data <B><I>encryption</I></B> not presently available.  The passive or semi-passive RFID application will require that the Authenticator
initiate all communication processes with the Requestors.  Various embodiments of the invention could be employed in security and inventory management applications.
<BR><BR>In another embodiment, public key <B><I>encryption</I></B> is used.  Reader authentication occurs as follows.  The reader requests to read or write tag data.  The tag responds with a challenge value (random number).  The reader encrypts the challenge value
using its private key.  The reader sends the encrypted challenge response to the tag.  The tag uses the reader public key to decrypt the challenge response.  The tag compares the results to the original challenge value and, if there is a match, the
reader is authenticated.
<BR><BR>The process for a tag authentication is as follows.  The reader issues a request to a tag including a non-encrypted challenge value.  The tag encrypts the challenge value using its private key, creating a challenge response.  The tag sends the
challenge response to the reader (no key is sent).  The reader decrypts the challenge response using the known tag's public key.  If the reader-computed result matches the original challenge value, the tag is authenticated.
<BR><BR>In another embodiment related to those just described, both a tag and a reader function to authenticate the other.  For example, a reader sends a non-encrypted first challenge value to a tag.  The tag encrypts the first challenge value using a
tag private key and sends it to the reader, as a first response, along with a non-encrypted second challenge value.  The reader decrypts the first response using a tag public key, and compares the result with the non-encrypted first challenge value.  If
the comparison is valid, then the tag is determined to be authentic.  The reader then encrypts the second challenge value using a reader private key and sends it to the tag as a second response.  The tag then decrypts the second response using a reader
public key, and compares the result with the non-encrypted second challenge value.  If the comparison in valid, then the reader is also determined to be authentic.  The tag and the reader may now continue with the exchange of data or commands.
<BR><BR>In the embodiments just described above, it is assumed that both the reader and the tag(s) know the public key or keys of the other, in advance of the authentication process.  This is a valid assumption if both (all) belong to the same
application.  In addition, multiple keys (public and private) may be used to realize corresponding level of security.  Generally, the longer (i.e., more complex) the key length, the greater the level of security within the exchange.  In the example just
described, the non-encrypted first and second challenge values may be the same; responses would be different due to different private keys.  Other embodiments using public and private keys are also possible.
<BR><BR>Inventory management incorporates a wide variety of situations where RF tags can be used.  These situations include the simple inventory/locating task of critical or high value items in storage, transport, or final use locations.  Integrating
authentication capability into the tags as described above would greatly increase the security of data contained within the tag and the item to which it is attached.
<BR><BR>Any design of RF tag can be used for security purposes.  The addition of authentication capability described above provides an additional mechanism against spoofing.  The security needs are many, with potential theft being high on the list.  The
traditional means of detecting when a theft has occurred is to track inventory.  Items can be identified as they are removed from a monitored area or when subsequent inventories are made of the storage location.
<BR><BR>Thus, methods and apparatus for authenticating reader or tags over a public, open channel have been provided.  A system has been provided that is more robust against spoofing and other illicit access attempts than password-based methods.
<BR><BR>Implementation requires minor changes to existing designs and is, for some embodiments, a matter of implementation in the RF tags' and readers' microprocessors.
<BR><BR>In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific as to structural and methodical features.  It is to be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific features shown and
described, since the means herein disclosed comprise preferred forms of putting the invention into effect.  The invention is, therefore, claimed in any of its forms or modifications within the proper scope of the appended claims appropriately interpreted
in accordance with the doctrine of equivalents.
