<P>Winner of the most frequently asked question award goes to Georges Meteskey of New York, NY, USA, who asks: <EM>"Why haven't I heard about this SGML stuff before?"</EM> Well, George, perhaps you were asleep during that lecture. </P>
<P>Truth be told, <B>SGML is a well-guarded secret</B>; it is an official international standard for the electronic interchange of information that has been adopted by the European Community, the governments of the US and Canada, the aerospace, automotive, semiconductor, defense and other industries. But somehow, despite all this acceptance, it remains one of the quietest revolutions around. Granted, Georges, it has acquired a reputation as being somewhat complicated, but the success of HTML -- which is in fact a simple application of SGML -- shows that anyone can play.</P></DIV2><DIV2><H2>SGML Available on the Web Today</H2><DIV3><!--Note: the first anchor here is called WHATSNEW in the NAME attribute--><H3><A HREF="http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/mgddf/guidesgml.html" NAME="whatsnew">Guide to Magellan Image Interpretation</A></H3>

<P>A collection of more than 300 Modern English texts is accessible through
both a search and browse interface, all made possible through the use

significant literary resources collected from around the Internet

All texts are searchable as a collection or in subsets; each text
may be extracted from the collection as an SGML document.  Texts
are encoded using the TEI "pocket" DTD (sometimes called the TEI Lite
DTD), available at <A HREF="ftp://ftp-tei.uic.edu/pub/tei/lite/lite14.dtd">ftp://ftp-tei.uic.edu/pub/tei/lite/lite14.dtd</A>.

<P><A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/oclc/research/panorama/demos/">A handful but growing collection of demo files</A> step you through the arguments for getting involved with full SGML on the Web. Anything you already know about HTML will stand you in good stead, but here are the reasons and their accompanying demos to show you how to move beyond HTML.</P>
<P>If you already know about SGML, the same demos will show you what capabilities you can exploit.</P><P><A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/oclc/research/panorama/demos/">http://www.oclc.org:5046/oclc/research/panorama/demos/</A></P>

<HR><HR></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2><H2>When to Put Full SGML onto the Web</H2>
<P>HTML, the SGML application of the World Wide Web, remains the very best way to encode your home page. That way you'll always know that any browser -- including Panorama -- will be able to display it. However, there will be many cases when you may want to use another SGML application.</P>
<UL><LI>When you already have documents richly marked up in another SGML application; now with Panorama being <A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/oclc/research/panorama/panorama.html">freely available</A> to the world and being ported to multiple platforms, <A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/oclc/research/panorama/top-ten-reasons.sgml"> there are at least ten good reasons for serving full SGML to the desktop (link ready soon)</A>.</LI>
<LI>Whenever you run into something that HTML won't let you do, and that HTML doesn't quite support; <A HREF="http://www.oclc.org:5046/oclc/research/panorama/demos/" NAME="sqdemos">the demo examples illustrate ...</A></LI>
<LI>When you have longer, more complex documents -- dictionaries, technical documentation, magazines, catalogs, government publications, academic journals, newspapers -- that you want to deliver using the world-wide distribution capabilities of the Web.</LI>
<LI>When you want greater control over the display of your on-line documents, control based not just on the element name (title, for example) but on the specific context of an element. (A title in a figure should be treated differently than a title of a book. You may want the first paragraph in a chapter to have different indentation from the others.)</LI>
<LI>When you want to include stylesheets with your document, so you can control an entire set of display styles -- or to offer a choice of styles.</LI></UL>
<P>Additional postings linked to this page provide tutorial assistance as well as sample files with a variety of kinds of markup.</P></DIV2><DIV2><H2><A NAME="tutdemos"></A>Putting SGML Online</H2><DIV3><H3>If You've Got SGML Today</H3>
<P>You have several choices:</P>
<UL><LI>Manually create stylesheets and navigators (those table of contents-like things that frequently appear at the left of the screen in Panorama). Use the samples in the <KBD>entityrc</KBD> directory as a guide. You may readily create new stylesheets and navigators by following the DTDs in the <KBD>catalog</KBD> directory, <KBD>sheet.ent</KBD> and <KBD>nav.ent</KBD> respectively.</LI>
<LI>Alternatively, purchase a license for the commercial version of the <EM>SoftQuad Panorama PRO</EM> software. From there, follow <A HREF="seven-easy-steps.sgml">seven simple steps (link ready soon)</A> to get your SGML files onto the Web.</LI></UL></DIV3><DIV3><H3>If You've Got HTML Today</H3>
<P>To use HTML with an SGML browser, you'll need to be a little more careful with the markup than many people have been in the past. You'll need to do two things:</P>
<OL><LI>Ensure that your files are valid HTML. There are a number of programs to check HTML documents, and you can also use a validating HTML editor such as <A HREF="http://www.sq.com/hm-ftp.htm">SoftQuad HoTMetaL</A>.</LI>
<LI>Make sure the HTML files begin with a DOCTYPE declaration that indicates the public identifier of the HTML DTD. Simply type this at the top of the file:<PRE>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"></PRE> and then be sure to follow it with the start-tag:<PRE>&lt;HTML></PRE>Similarly, the file needs to end with:<PRE>&lt;/HTML></PRE></LI></OL>
<P>Panorama is <EM>not</EM> a substitute for a full-blown Web browser; its strength is in its support for whatever tags anyone chooses to throw at it. It does not handle HTML forms or ISMAP; use your regular Web browser for that kind of functionality. HTML makes sense in Panorama only if you have regular text and graphics files and want to use the additional stylesheet or navigator or linking capabilities.</P></DIV3><DIV3><H3>If You've Got Neither HTML nor SGML</H3>
<UL><LI>Create documents which use the same markup as the sample files shipped with Panorama. This markup is formally <EM>declared</EM> in <EM>Document Type Definitions (DTDs)</EM> which configure SGML software (such as Panorama or SGML editors and other browsers) to recognize their markup. Several DTDs are shipped with Panorama. There is a great variety, and we provide a <A HREF="dtdlist.sgm">brief description of each (link ready soon)</A> along with some documentation for them and sample files. </LI></UL></DIV3></DIV2><DIV2><H2><A NAME="resources"></A>SGML Resources on the Web</H2><DIV3><H3>SoftQuad's SGML Primer</H3>
