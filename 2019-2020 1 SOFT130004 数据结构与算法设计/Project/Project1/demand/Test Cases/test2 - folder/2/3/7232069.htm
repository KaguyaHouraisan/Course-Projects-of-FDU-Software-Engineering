     so as to disable or reduce the effective range of the antenna. The <B><I>RFID</I></B>
     device includes a transceiver that uses the antenna to carry on
     communications with an <B><I>RFID</I></B> reader. The transceiver can set the states of
     switches in order to set the reader to a desired state. The reader is
     capable of issuing commands to the <B><I>RFID</I></B> device, acted on by the
     transceiver in order to set states of switches in order to achieve a
     desired state for the <B><I>RFID</I></B> device. The reader may issue commands through
     RF communication, or alternatively may issue commands through a close
     proximity interface, for example through contacts or through an inductive
     connection, allowing the state of the device to be reset after the RF
     capability of the device has been disabled or reduced.

<BR><BR>The present invention relates generally to improvements to radio frequency identification (RFID) systems used for control of goods.  More particularly, the invention relates to systems and techniques for disabling, enabling or setting the range
of an RFID device such as an RFID tag, for example after a transaction involving goods identified by the tag has been completed or after the return to a retailer of goods bearing a previously disabled RFID tag.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems offer the possibility of inexpensive and efficient management of goods, with applications in inventory control and retail checkout.  Each item in an inventory, for example in a retail store or a
warehouse, may be equipped with an RFID tag, that is, a tag containing an RFID emitter that supplies information about the product to an RFID reader.  The information may include product identification information, such as manufacturer and item
identifiers, similar to those provided by a standard universal product code bar code.  The information may also include a unique serial number or other unique identifier, so that each individual item may be easily identified by a reader or readers and
the movements of identified items may be tracked.  Typical RFID readers broadcast an RF signal.  Tags within the range of the reader return a signal to the reader, typically in the form of modulated backscatter of the signal emitted by the reader.
<BR><BR>A reader may be placed at a desired inventory control point, such as a retail checkout station or an entrance to or exit of a retail location, warehouse or other area where goods are located.  Tags coming within range of the reader are powered by
the reader's RF signal and transmit tag information which is detected by the reader.  The information detected by the reader may be used in operations, such as purchase transactions, involving the item or items whose information was detected.  Such
operations may include entry of a product into a transaction or logging the entry of an item into or the exit of an item from a retail location, warehouse or other controlled environment.
<BR><BR>The use of RFID devices for management of goods offers possibilities of fast and efficient control of goods.  For example, a customer might bring a cart full of goods bearing RFID tags to a terminal, which would include a reader receiving product
identification information for each product.  The terminal would retrieve product information, such as price or descriptive information for each product.  The terminal would then enter product information for each product into a transaction and present
the customer with a list of goods in the transaction and a transaction total.  The customer would then tender payment, the transaction would be recorded and the goods would be removed from the retailer's inventory records.
<BR><BR>In another application, a warehouse inventory could be continuously updated by one or more RFID readers located in the warehouse and continually sensing RFID signals from goods located in the warehouse.  An RFID reader located at an entry or exit
point of a location could record the passage of goods through that location, and could secure the entry or exit point to prevent the exit of an item if the item was not properly entered into the transaction.
<BR><BR>The use of RFID tags for management of goods can be expected to allow for a significant reduction in the labor required to enter transactions and to prevent the unauthorized removal of goods.  If each item transmits an identifying code that can
be detected by a reader, tracking and control of the item may be performed automatically.  However, many customers have serious privacy concerns at the prospect of a tag that can transmit identifying information at a considerable distance from the tag. 
The use of such tags raises a possibility that goods owned by a customer could be identified by someone who had no legitimate need for the information.  It is possible that RFID product identification could be used in highly intrusive ways.  For example,
a marketer or other person could conceivably install an RFID reader in a public place, and identify goods owned by unknowing passersby.  If unaddressed, privacy concerns might seriously inhibit customer acceptance of retail use of RFID systems.
<BR><BR>For best and most versatile use, an RFID tag used in a retail environment should be able to communicate information over a fairly great distance, at least several feet or perhaps tens of feet.  Such communication ranges allow for relatively wide
coverage for a reader used for transactions or security and allow for relatively unobtrusive placement of readers, for example in a relatively high ceiling.  However, after a product has been paid for and left the retail establishment, the retailer no
longer needs to track or monitor the product, and the product does not need to be able to communicate over such distances.
<BR><BR>There exists, therefore, a need for systems and techniques for RFID communication that allow for an RFID tag to be disabled, or its communication range reduced, when the tracking or monitoring of a product associated with the tag is no longer
required.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A system according to an aspect of the present invention employs RFID devices having antennas including switches whose states can be changed so as to disable or reduce the effective range of the antenna.  Each of the RFID devices includes a
transceiver that uses the antenna to carry on communications with an RFID reader, which may be one of a plurality of readers deployed in an installation.  The transceiver is capable of setting the states of switches in order to set the antenna to a
desired state.  The switches may be irreversible, in which case a switch cannot be set to an original state after its state has been changed, or may be reversible, in which case a switch can be restored to a previous state.  Each reader is capable of
issuing commands to the RFID device, which are acted on by the transceiver in order to set states of switches in order to achieve a desired state for the RFID device.  The reader may issue commands through RF communication, or alternatively may issue
commands through a close proximity interface, such as, for example, through contacts or through an inductive connection, allowing the state of the device to be set after the RF capability of the device has been disabled or reduced.
<BR><BR>A more complete understanding of the present invention, as well as further features and advantages of the invention, will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the accompanying drawings. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 illustrates an RFID tag 100 according to an aspect of the present invention.  The tag 100 comprises an information transceiver 102, comprising memory 104 for storing information to be communicated, a processor 106 for reading the memory
104 and formatting a transmission for communication, and a communications interface 107 for producing an RF signal for transmission.  The transceiver 102 is connected to an antenna 108 through first and second antenna connections 110 and 112.
<BR><BR>The RFID tag 100 receives power from a radio frequency (RF) field emitted by an RFID reader (not shown in FIG. 1, but discussed below and illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3).  The transceiver 102 modulates the signal received at the antenna 108 and
communicates with the reader through a modulated backscatter signal emitted using the antenna 108.  While the tag 100 is described as a passive tag communicating with an RFID reader through modulated backscatter of a field emitted by the reader, it will
be recognized that other designs for RFID tags may be used.  For example, an RFID tag may include an active transmitter powered by a battery incorporated into the tag.  The teachings of the present invention may easily be adapted for use with such a tag,
or for use with other designs of RFID tags.
<BR><BR>The range of the RFID tag 100 depends on factors including the effective length of the antenna 108.  The antenna connections 110 and 112 must have an open circuit between them in order for the antenna 108 to emit a signal that conveys
information.  That is, the antenna connection 110 must connect to the antenna 108 and the antenna connection 112 must connect to the antenna 108, but a connection directly between the antenna connections 110 and 112 shorts the connections and disables
the transmission capability of the device 100.
<BR><BR>Therefore, the RFID tag 100 includes a shorting connector 114 between the antenna connections 110 and 112.  The shorting connector 114 includes a switch 115.  When the switch 115 is closed, a short is present between the connections 110 and 112
and the antenna 108 is unable to transmit.  When the switch 115 is open, the connections 110 and 112 are isolated from one another and the antenna can operate normally.  The switch 115 is controllable by the transceiver 102.
<BR><BR>The shorting connector 114 and the switch 115 may suitably be incorporated into the transceiver 102.  The transceiver 102 will typically be embodied as an integrated circuit, and the switch 119 can easily be incorporated into the design of such a
circuit at a very low cost per unit.
<BR><BR>The RFID tag may also include a switch 116, placed at a selected point on the antenna 108.  Opening the switch 116 reduces the effective length of the antenna 108 and reduces the effective range of the RFID tag 100.  The precise reduction of
range that is achieved by opening the switch 116 depends on the placement of the switch 116.  It will be recognized that the tag 100 may include the combination of the connector 114 with the switch 115, the switch 116, or both of these elements.  If only
a capability to completely disable the transmission capability of the tag 100 is required, only the combination of the connector 114 with the switch 115 is needed.  If only the capability to reduce the range of the tag 100 is required, only the switch
116 is needed.  It will also be recognized that additional switches may be incorporated into the tag 100, if it is desired to select from among several different antenna lengths and, therefore, ranges for the tag 100.
<BR><BR>As an alternative, or in addition, to the combination of the connector 114 and the switch 115 incorporated into the transceiver 102, the tag 100 may include a connector 118 and a switch 119, external to the transceiver 102.  Depending on the
particular uses to which the tag 100 is to be put, the switches 115, 116, 118 and any other switches incorporated into the tag 100, may be reversible or irreversible.  If the switches are irreversible, they cannot be restored to a previous state once
their state has been changed, and changing the states of the switches permanently disables the tag 100 or permanently reduces its range.  Alternatively, a switch may be able to be restored to a previous state at some point after its state has been
changed, for example, if a product bearing the tag 100 has been returned by a customer and returned to stock.  In such a case, restoring switches to a previous state restores the tag 100 to its original state, restoring its original transmission ability
and range.
<BR><BR>The switches 115, 116, 118 and similar switches that may be incorporated into the tag 100 are controlled by commands issued by the transceiver 102.  Each of the switches may have an address and recognize commands issued to that address.  The
processor 106 formats a command and transmits it using the input/output connections 108 and 110.  The addressed switch recognizes and acts on the command.  The command may be protected by a password or <B><I>encryption</I></B> message to prevent inadvertent or hostile
attempts to disable the tag 100.
<BR><BR>The tag 100 may suitably receive switch commands transmitted by an RF signal, for example, a signal transmitted by a reader.  In that case, the transceiver 102 receives the signal through the input/output connections 108 and 110 and processes the
signal to extract the command.
<BR><BR>Once the state of one of the switches 115, 116, 118 or a similar switch has been changed so as to disable the tag 100 or reduce its range, the RF communication capability of the tag 100 is disabled or impaired.  For this reason, and to give the
tag 100 additional communication capabilities, the tag 100 may suitably be provided with a proximity communication interface 120.  The interface 120 may suitably include contacts 122 and 124.  Commands may be issued to and information received from the
tag 100 by touching the contacts 122 and 124 against a suitable surface of an RFID reader.  In addition or as an alternative to the contacts 122 and 124, the interface 120 may include an inductive connection 126, allowing the tag 100 to receive commands
and provide information to an RFID or other suitable device at a range of a few inches.  In this way, the tag 100 can be disabled sufficiently to prevent any privacy concerns, while still retaining the ability to be re-enabled, and to provide information
in a retail environment even if its RF capability is disabled.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 illustrates an RFID reader 200 according to an aspect of the present invention.  The reader 200 includes a transmitter 202, a receiver 204, a processor 206, memory 208 and an antenna 210.  The reader 200 uses the transmitter 202 to
broadcast an RF signal to RFID tags in its vicinity, in order to provide power to the tags and, if desired, issue commands to the tags.  The reader 200 uses the receiver 204 to receive transmissions from tags within its vicinity.  The transmissions
preferably follow a prescribed format for the transmission of digital information and include information such as a product identifier and a tag serial number.
<BR><BR>The processor 206 and the memory 208 are used to manage operation of the reader 200, to prepare signals and commands to be sent using the transmitter 204 and to interpret signals received using the receiver 204 and to extract and store
information provided by the signals.  The reader 200 also includes an external interface 212, for communicating with other devices in an establishment where the reader 200 is used.  The reader 200 may suitably be used in and receive commands from a
terminal (not shown here, but discussed below and illustrated in FIG. 3) used to perform retail transactions.  In such an implementation, the reader 200 receives commands from the terminal through the external interface 212.
<BR><BR>When an RFID tag is to be disabled or is to be subject to range reduction, the reader 200 sends an appropriate signal to the tag, instructing the tag to open or close switches as appropriate to perform the desired operation.  The signal may
suitably include the specific identification of the RFID tag on which the operation is to be performed, in order to avoid unintentional disabling or range reduction of other tags.
<BR><BR>The reader 200 further includes an RFID tag disabling interface 214, to allow disabling or reducing the range of a tag without sending an RF signal to the tag.  The tag disabling interface 214 receives instructions from the processor 206 and
transmits commands through contacts 216 and 218, through an inductive connection 220, or both.  It will be recognized that a reader such as the reader 200 may include the set of contacts 216 and 218, the inductive connection 220 or both, depending on the
particular capabilities desired.  It will also be recognized that other techniques may be used to give the reader 200 the capability to communicate with an RFID tag through direct contact or short range communication.
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 illustrates a terminal 300 according to an aspect of the present invention.  The terminal 300 may be operated in a retail establishment employing the terminal 300 and a plurality of similar terminals, a plurality of RFID readers employed
at entrances and exits to provide security, and various other facilities for performing transactions and controlling and tracking the movement of goods.
<BR><BR>The terminal 300 suitably includes a processor 302, memory 304, long term storage 306, a user interface 308, bar code scanner 310 and an external device interface 312.  The terminal 300 is preferably adapted to accept user inputs from the user
interface 308 and receive information, commands and programming from the external device interface 312.  The terminal 300 includes an RFID reader 314, similar to the reader 200 of FIG. 2.  The reader 314 receives product identification information from
RFID tags attached to products, the RFID tags being similar to the tag 100 of FIG. 1.  Once the terminal 300 has received identification information from an RFID tag, the terminal 300 can obtain product information through the external device interface
312, for example from a price lookup table 316 hosted on a server 318 accessible through a local area network 320.  If a product lacks an RFID tag, the bar code scanner 310 or the user interface 308 may be used to enter product identification
information.
<BR><BR>Once a purchase transaction is complete, the terminal 300 suitably performs operations on RFID tags associated with goods in order to disable or reduce the range of the tags.  The operations are preferably performed according to preprogrammed
instructions, suitably stored in the long term storage 306 or memory 304, in order to avoid errors or omissions by a customer or checker and to provide for a quick and efficient operation.  The processor 302 issues appropriate commands to the reader 314,
and the reader operates in a manner similar to that of the reader described above and illustrated in FIG. 2.
<BR><BR>If a product bearing a disabled RFID tag is returned and is to be returned to stock, the terminal 300 may suitably be used to re-enable the RFID tag.  In such a case, the terminal 300 is typically operated by an employee of the establishment
after the customer has returned the product.  The user interface 308 is employed to instruct the reader 314 to issue appropriate commands to the RFID tag, and the reader 314 operates to re-enable the tag in a manner similar to that described above in
connection with FIG. 2.
<BR><BR>FIG. 4 illustrates a process 400 of transaction management and control of goods according to an aspect of the present invention.  At step 402, a collection of goods bearing RFID tags is brought within the range of an RFID reader associated with a
transaction terminal.  The tags may suitably be similar to the tag 100 of FIG. 1 and the reader may suitably be similar to the reader 200 of FIG. 2.  At step 404, signals emitted by the tags are received and analyzed to obtain product identification
information for products associated with the tags.  At step 406, product identification information obtained from the signals used to retrieve product information, such as price information and product descriptions.  At step 408, the product information
for each product is entered into a transaction.  At step 410, upon completion of the transaction, each tag associated with a product entered into the transaction is disabled as described above in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2.  Depending on the design
and operation of the tags and readers, the tags may be completely disabled or may be subject to a range reduction.  In addition, it is possible to operate on all tags associated with products entered into the tags or only on a selection of tags,
depending on operational choices.  For example, a consumer may be given the opportunity to make general or specific selection in order to determined what operations will be performed on which tags, for example disabling some tags, reducing the range of
some tags and leaving some tags in their original state.  Which operations are performed on which tags can be left up to the consumer or may be decided by other, predetermined criteria.
<BR><BR>RFID tags used in a transaction may be so designed that they can be restored to a previous state after their state has been changed.  In the case of retail sales, particularly, return of a product from a customer is commonly accepted, and if the
product is returned unused or in suitable condition, it may be returned to stock.  At step 412, upon return of a product from a customer, with the product bearing an RFID tag capable of being restored to a previous state, the tag is restored to the
previous state using the techniques described above in connection with FIGS. 1, 2 and 3.
<BR><BR>While the present invention is disclosed in the context of a presently preferred embodiment, it will be recognized that a wide variety of implementations may be employed by persons of ordinary skill in the art consistent with the above discussion
and the claims which follow below.
