The sums are computed as described in FIPS\-180\-2.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a
line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary,
\&' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
