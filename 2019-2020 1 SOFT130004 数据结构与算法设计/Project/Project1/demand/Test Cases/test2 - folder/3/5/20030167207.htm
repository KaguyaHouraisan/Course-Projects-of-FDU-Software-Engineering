     60/396,657 filed Jul. 16, 2002, all incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002] This invention generally relates to a system and method for
     completing a transaction, and more particularly, to completing a
     financial transaction using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in
     contact and contactless environments.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0003] Like barcode and voice data entry, RFID is a contactless
     information acquisition technology. RFID systems are wireless, and are
     usually extremely effective in hostile environments where conventional
     acquisition methods fail. RFID has established itself in a wide range of
     markets, such as, for example, the high-speed reading of railway
     containers, tracking moving objects such as livestock or automobiles, and
     retail inventory applications. As such, RFID technology has become a
     primary focus in automated data collection, identification and analysis
     systems worldwide.
<BR><BR>[0004] Of late, companies are increasingly embodying RFID data acquisition
     technology in a fob or tag for use in completing financial transactions.
     A typical fob includes a transponder and is ordinarily a self-contained
     device which may be contained on any portable form factor. In some
     instances, a battery may be included with the fob to power the
     transponder. In which case the internal circuitry of the fob (including
     the transponder) may draw its operating power from the battery power
     source. Alternatively, the fob may exist independent of an internal power
     source. In this instance the internal circuitry of the fob (including the
     transponder) may gain its operating power directly from an RF
     interrogation signal. U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,774 issued to Schuermann
     describes a typical transponder RF interrogation system which may be
     found in the prior art. The Schuermann patent describes in general the
     powering technology surrounding conventional transponder structures. U.S.
     Pat. No. 4,739,328 discusses a method by which a conventional transponder
     may respond to a RF interrogation signal. Other typical modulation
     techniques which may be used include, for example, ISO/IEC 14443 and the
     like.
<BR><BR>[0005] In the conventional fob powering technologies used, the fob is
     typically activated upon presenting the fob in an interrogation signal.
     In this regard, the fob may be activated irrespective of whether the user
     desires such activation. Inadvertent presentation of the fob may result
     in initiation and completion of an unwanted transaction. Thus, a fob
     system is needed which allows the fob user to control activation of the
     fob to limit transactions being undesirably completed.
<BR><BR>[0006] One of the more visible uses of the RFID technology is found in the
     introduction of Exxon/Mobil's Speedpass.RTM. and Shell's EasyPay.RTM.
     products. These products use transponders placed in a fob or tag which
     enables automatic identification of the user when the fob is presented at
     a Point of Sale (POS) device. Fob identification data is typically passed
     to a third party server database, where the identification data is
     referenced to a customer (e.g., user) credit or debit account. In an
     exemplary processing method, the server seeks authorization for the
     transaction by passing the transaction and account data to an authorizing
     entity. Once authorization is received by the server, clearance is sent
     to the point of sale device for completion of the transaction. In this
     way, the conventional transaction processing method involves an indirect
     path which causes undue overhead due to the use of the third-party
     server.
<BR><BR>[0007] A need exists for a transaction authorization system which allows
     fob transactions to be authorized while eliminating the cost associated
     with using third-party servers.
<BR><BR>[0008] In addition, conventional fobs are limited in that they must be
     used in proximity to the Point of Sale device. That is, for fob
     activation, conventional fobs must be positioned within the area of
     transmission cast by the RF interrogation signal. More particularly,
     conventional fobs are not affective for use in situations where the user
     wishes to conduct a transaction at a point of interaction such as a
     computer interface.
<BR><BR>[0009] Therefore, a need exists for a fob embodying RFID acquisition
     technology, which is capable of use at a point of interaction device and
     which is additionally capable of facilitating transactions via a computer
     interface connected to a network (e.g., the Internet).
<BR><BR>[0010] Existing transponder-reader payment systems are also limited in
     that the conventional fob used in the systems is only responsive to one
     interrogation signal. Where multiple interrogation signals are used, the
     fob is only responsive to the interrogation signal to which it is
     configured. Thus, if the RFID reader of the system provides only an
     interrogation signal to which the fob is incompatible, the fob will not
     be properly activated.
<BR><BR>[0011] Therefore, a need exists for a fob which is responsive to more than
     one interrogation signal.
<BR><BR>[0012] Existing transponder-reader payment systems are additionally
     limited in that the payment systems are typically linked to a funding
     source associated with the transponder which includes a predetermined
     spending limit. Thus no flexibility is provided in instances where the
     payment is requested which exceeds the predetermined spending limit. This
     is typically true in that traditional methods for processing a requested
     transaction involve comparing the transaction to the spending limit or to
     an amount stored in a preloaded value data file prior to providing
     transaction authorization to a merchant.
<BR><BR>[0013] Thus, a system is needed which processes transponder-reader payment
     requests irrespective of the spending limit assigned to an associated
     transponder-reader payment system funding source.
<BR><BR>[0014] Further, traditional transponder-reader systems do not permit the
     user to manage the system user account data. This is extremely
     problematic where the user wishes to change a transponder-reader system
     funding source to a source which provides more available spending room,
     or where changes are made to the user's status (e.g., change in address,
     phone number, email, etc.) for which the transponder-reader account
     provider wishes to readily update the user's account.
<BR><BR>[0015] Thus a need exists for a transponder-reader system which will allow
     the user limited access to the transponder-reader account for managing
     account data.
<BR><BR>[0016] Further still, existing transponder-reader systems do not usually
     permit means for automatically incenting the use of the fob associated
     with the system as opposed to the credit or charge card associated with
     the fob. That is, conventional transponder-reader systems do not provide
     a means for encouraging usage of the transponder reader system by
     encouraging use of the fob product since the present systems do not
     sufficiently distinguish between usage of a system transponder and a
     charge or credit card account associated with the transponder.
<BR><BR>[0017] Consequently, a need exists for a transponder-reader system which
     is capable of determining when a system transponder is used, and
     providing an incentive for such usage.
<BR><BR>[0018] Sill further, present systems are limited in that the systems are
     unable to track credit or charge card usage and fob usage for a single
     funding source. For example, in typical prior art systems, a fob may be
     linked to a specified funding source (e.g., American Express, MasterCard,
     Visa, etc.) which may be used to provide funds for satisfaction of a
     transaction request. The funding source may additionally have a consumer
     credit or charge card which may be associated with the fob and which may
     be used for contact transactions. Where the credit or charge card is
     used, a statement reporting the card usage is provided to the card user.
     However, the reporting statement does not include a reporting of the fob
     product usage. Thus, a fob user is unable to adequately chart, analyze or
     compare fob usage to the usage of the associated card. This is especially
     problematic where the funding source is used by more than one entity
     (e.g., spouses, multiple company personnel, etc.) or where one entity may
     use the fob and a separate entity may use the card associated with the
     fob.
<BR><BR>[0019] Thus, a need exists for a transponder-reader payment system which
     would permit reporting of the fob usage and the credit card usage in a
     single file.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0020] Described herein is a system and method for using RFID technology
     to initiate and complete financial transactions. The transponder-reader
     payment system described herein may include a RFID reader operable to
     provide a RF interrogation signal for powering a transponder system,
     receiving a transponder system RF signal, and providing transponder
     system account data relative to the transponder system RF signal. The
     transponder-reader payment system may include a RFID protocol/sequence
     controller in electrical communication with one or more interrogators for
     providing an interrogation signal to a transponder, a RFID authentication
     circuit for authenticating the signal received from the transponder, a
     serial or parallel interface for interfacing with a point of interaction
     device, and an USB or serial interface for use in personalizing the RFID
     reader and/or the transponder. The transponder-reader payment system may
     further include a fob including one or more transponders (e.g., modules)
     responsive to one or more interrogation signals and for providing an
     authentication signal for verifying that the transponder and/or the RFID
     reader are authorized to operate within the transponder-reader payment
     system. In this way, the fob may be responsive to multiple interrogation
     signals provided at different frequencies. Further, the fob may include a
     USB or serial interface for use with a computer network or with the RFID
     reader.
<BR><BR>[0021] The RFID system and method according to the present invention may
     include a transponder which may be embodied in a fob, tag, card or any
     other form factor (e.g., wristwatch, keychain, cell phone, etc.), which
     may be capable of being presented for interrogation. In that regard,
     although the transponder is described herein as embodied in a fob, the
     invention is not so limited.
<BR><BR>[0022] The system may further include a RFID reader configured to send a
     standing RFID recognition signal which may be transmitted from the RFID
     reader via radio frequency (or electromagnetic) propagation. The fob may
     be placed within proximity to the RFID reader such that the RFID signal
     may interrogate the fob and initialize fob identification procedures.
<BR><BR>[0023] In one exemplary embodiment, as a part of the identification
     process, the fob and the RFID reader may engage in mutual authentication.
     The RFID reader may identify the fob as including an authorized system
     transponder for receiving encrypted information and storing the
     information on the fob memory. Similarly, the fob, upon interrogation by
     the RFID reader, may identify the RFID reader as authorized to receive
     the encrypted and stored information. Where the RFID reader and the fob
     successfully mutually authenticate, the fob may transmit to the RFID
     reader certain information identifying the transaction account or
     accounts to which the fob is associated. The RFID reader may receive the
     information and forward the information to facilitate the completion of a
     transaction. In one exemplary embodiment, the RFID reader may forward the
     information to a point of interaction device (e.g., POS or computer
     interface) for transaction completion. The mutual authorization process
     disclosed herein aids in ensuring fob transponder-reader payment system
     security.
<BR><BR>[0024] In another exemplary embodiment, the fob according to the present
     invention, includes means for completing transactions via a computer
     interface. The fob may be connected to the computer using a USB or serial
     interface fob account information may be transferred to the computer for
     use in completing a transaction via a network (e.g., the Internet).
<BR><BR>[0025] In yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a
     system is provided which incents usage of the transponder-reader system
     transponder (e.g., fob). The system distinguishes between the usage of a
     fob and the usage of a charge or credit card sharing the same funding
     source as the fob. Where the fob is used, the system may provide
     incentives to the user based on criteria predetermined by the fob issuer.
     Additionally, where a preloaded fob system is used, the present invention
     recognizes when the associated fob preloaded value data file is loaded or
     reloaded with funds. The invention then may provide reward points based
     on the criteria associated with the loading or reloading action. Further,
     the system according to this invention may incent patronage of a
     merchant. In this case, the system may receive a fob transaction request
     and incent the fob user based on a marker or other identifier correlated
     with the merchant. The marker may be included in the transaction
     identification, in a merchant identification provided with the
     transaction, or a combination of both.
<BR><BR>[0026] In still another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a system is
     disclosed which enables the fob user/owner to manage the account
     associated with the fob. The user is provided limited access to all or a
     portion of the fob account information stored on the account provider
     database for updating, for example, demographic information, account
     funding source, and/or account restrictions (e.g., spending limits,
     personal identification number, etc.). Access to all or a portion of the
     account may be provided to the user telephonically, via a network (e.g.,
     online) or via offline communications. For example, the fob user may be
     provided access to a system which has delayed communications with the
     account provider database wherein such a system may include, for example,
     a kiosk which provides batch transmissions to the account provider
     system. In this way, the fob user/owner may update his account
     information in real-time (e.g. telephonically or online) or at the time
     the account provider receives the updated information (e.g., off line).
<BR><BR>[0027] In a further exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides
     methods for processing a transaction request whereby the amount of the
     transaction request may be approved prior to requesting funding from the
     funding source and/or verifying that the amount for completing the
     transaction is available. In this way, the transaction may be approved
     provided the transaction and/or account meets certain predetermined
     authorization criteria. Once the criteria is met, the transaction is
     authorized and authorization is provided to the requesting agent (e.g.,
     merchant). In one instance the payment for the transaction is requested
     from the funding source simultaneously to, or immediately following, the
     providing of the authorization to the merchant. In another instance, the
     payment for transactions is requested at a time period later than when
     the authorization is provided to the merchant.
<BR><BR>[0028] These features and other advantages of the system and method, as
     well as the structure and operation of various exemplary embodiments of
     the system and method, are described below.

     algorithms being implemented with any combination of data structures,
     objects, processes, routines or other programming elements. Further, it
     should be noted that the present invention may employ any number of
     conventional techniques for data transmission, signaling, data
     processing, network control, and the like. For a basic introduction on
     cryptography, review a text written by Bruce Schneier entitled "Applied
     Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C," published by
     John Wiley & Sons (second edition, 1996), herein incorporated by
     reference.
<BR><BR>[0045] In addition, many applications of the present invention could be
     formulated. The exemplary network disclosed herein may include any system
     for exchanging data or transacting business, such as the internet, an
     intranet, an extranet, WAN, LAN, satellite communications, and/or the
     like. It is noted that the network may be implemented as other types of
     networks, such as an interactive television network (ITN).
<BR><BR>[0046] Where required, the system user may interact with the system via
     any input device such as, a keypad, keyboard, mouse, kiosk, personal

     Blueberry.RTM.), cellular phone and/or the like. Similarly, the invention
     could be used in conjunction with any type of personal computer, network
     computer, work station, minicomputer, mainframe, or the like running any
     operating system such as any version of Windows, Windows NT, Windows
     2000, Windows 98, Windows 95, MacOS, OS/2, BeOS, Linux, UNIX, Solaris or
     the like. Moreover, although the invention may frequently be described as
     being implemented with TCP/IP communications protocol, it should be
     understood that the invention could also be implemented using SNA, IPX,
     Appletalk, IPte, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of communications protocols.
     Moreover, the system contemplates, the use, sale, or distribution of any
     goods, services or information over any network having similar
     functionality described herein.
<BR><BR>[0047] FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary RFID transaction system 100A in
     accordance with the present invention, wherein exemplary components for
     use in completing a fob transaction are depicted. In general, the
     operation of system 100A may begin when fob 102 is presented for payment,
     and is interrogated by RFID reader 104 or, alternatively, interface 134.
     Fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may then engage in mutual authentication
     after which the transponder 102 may provide the transponder
     identification and/or account identifier to the RFID reader 104 which may
     further provide the information to the merchant system 130 POS device
     110.
<BR><BR>[0048] System 100A may include a fob 102 having a transponder 114 and a
     RFID reader 104 in RF communication with fob 102. Although the present
     invention is described with respect to a fob 102, the invention is not to
     be so limited. Indeed, system 100 may include any device having a
     transponder which is configured to communicate with a RFID reader 104 via
     RF communication. Typical devices may include, for example, a key ring,
     tag, card, cell phone, wristwatch or any such form capable of being
     presented for interrogation.
<BR><BR>[0049] The RFID reader 104 may be configured to communicate using a RFID
     internal antenna 106. Alternatively, RFID reader 104 may include an
     external antenna 108 for communications with fob 102, where the external
     antenna may be made remote to the RFID reader 104 using a suitable cable
     and/or data link 120. RFID reader 104 may be further in communication
     with a merchant system 130 via a data link 122. The system 100A may
     include a transaction completion system including a point of interaction
     device such as, for example, a merchant point of sale (POS) device 110 or
     a computer interface (e.g., user interface) 134. In one exemplary
     embodiment the transaction completion system may include a merchant
     system 130 including the POS device 110 in communication with a RFID
     reader 104 (via data link 122). As described more fully below, the
     transaction completion system may include the user interface 134
     connected to a network 136 and to the transponder via a USB connector
     132.
<BR><BR>[0050] Although the point of interaction device is described herein with
     respect to a merchant point of sale (POS) device, the invention is not to
     be so limited. Indeed, a merchant POS device is used herein by way of
     example, and the point of interaction device may be any device capable of
     receiving fob account data. In this regard, the POS may be any point of
     interaction device enabling the user to complete a transaction using a
     fob 102. POS device 110 may be in further communication with a customer
     interface 118 (via data link 128) for entering at least a customer
     identity verification information. In addition, POS device 110 may be in
     communication with a merchant host network 112 (via data link 124) for
     processing any transaction request. In this arrangement, information
     provided by RFID reader 104 is provided to the POS device 110 of merchant
     system 130 via data link 122. The POS device 110 may receive the
     information (and alternatively may receive any identity verifying
     information from customer interface 118 via data link 128) and provide
     the information to host system 112 for processing.
<BR><BR>[0051] A variety of conventional communications media and protocols may be
     used for data links 120, 122, 124, and 128. For example, data links 120,
     122, 124, and 128 may be an Internet Service Provider (ISP) configured to
     facilitate communications over a local loop as is typically used in
     connection with standard modem communication, cable modem, dish networks,
     ISDN, Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL), or any wireless communication
     media. In addition, the merchant system 130 including the POS device 110
     and host network 112 may reside on a local area network which interfaces
     to a remote network (not shown) for remote authorization of an intended
     transaction. The merchant system 130 may communicate with the remote
     network via a leased line, such as a T1, D3 line, or the like. Such
     communications lines are described in a variety of texts, such as,
     "Understanding Data Communications," by Gilbert Held, which is
     incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0052] An account number, as used herein, may include any identifier for
     an account (e.g., credit, charge debit, checking, savings, reward,
     loyalty, or the like) which may be maintained by a transaction account
     provider (e.g., payment authorization center) and which may be used to
     complete a financial transaction. A typical account number (e.g., account
     data) may be correlated to a credit or debit account, loyalty account, or
     rewards account maintained and serviced by such entities as American
     Express.RTM., Visa.RTM. and/or MasterCard.RTM. or the like. For ease in
     understanding, the present invention may be described with respect to a
     credit account. However, it should be noted that the invention is not so
     limited and other accounts permitting an exchange of goods and services
     for an account data value is contemplated to be within the scope of the
     present invention.
<BR><BR>[0053] In addition, the account number (e.g., account data) may be
     associated with any device, code, or other identifier/indicia suitably
     configured to allow the consumer to interact or communicate with the
     system, such as, for example, authorization/access code, personal
     identification number (PIN), Internet code, digital certificate,
     biometric data, and/or other identification indicia. The account number
     may be optionally located on a rewards card, charge card, credit card,
     debit card, prepaid card, telephone card, smart card, magnetic stripe
     card, bar code card, and/or the like. The account number may be
     distributed and stored in any form of plastic, electronic, magnetic,
     and/or optical device capable of transmitting or downloading data to a
     second device. A customer account number may be, for example, a
     sixteen-digit credit card number, although each credit provider has its
     own numbering system, such as the fifteen-digit numbering system used by
     American Express.RTM.. Each company's credit card numbers comply with
     that company's standardized format such that the company using a
     sixteen-digit format will generally use four spaced sets of numbers, as
     represented by the number "0000 0000 0000 0000". In a typical example,
     the first five to seven digits are reserved for processing purposes and
     identify the issuing bank, card type and, etc. In this example, the last
     sixteenth digit is used as a sum check for the sixteen-digit number. The
     intermediary eight-to-ten digits are used to uniquely identify the
     customer. The account number stored as Track 1 and Track 2 data as
     defined in ISO/IEC 7813, and further may be made unique to fob 102. In
     one exemplary embodiment, the account number may include a unique fob
     serial number and user identification number, as well as specific
     application applets. The account number may be stored in fob 102 inside a
     database 214, as described more fully below. Database 214 may be
     configured to store multiple account numbers issued to the fob 102 user
     by the same or different account providing institutions. Where the
     account data corresponds to a loyalty or rewards account, the database
     214 may be configured to store the attendant loyalty or rewards points
     data.
<BR><BR>[0054] FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of the many functional blocks of
     an exemplary fob 102 in accordance with the present invention. Fob 102
     may be a RFID fob 102 which may be presented by the user to facilitate an
     exchange of funds or points, etc., for receipt of goods or services. As
     described herein, by way of example, the fob 102 may be a RFID fob which
     may be presented for facilitating payment for goods and/or services.
<BR><BR>[0055] Fob 102 may include an antenna 202 for receiving an interrogation
     signal from RFID reader 104 via antenna 106 (or alternatively, via
     external antenna 108). Fob antenna 202 may be in communication with a
     transponder 114. In one exemplary embodiment, transponder 114 may be a
     13.56 MHz transponder compliant with the ISO/IEC 14443 standard, and
     antenna 202 may be of the 13 MHz variety. The transponder 114 may be in
     communication with a transponder compatible modulator/demodulator 206
     configured to receive the signal from transponder 114 and configured to
     modulate the signal into a format readable by any later connected
     circuitry. Further, modulator/demodulator 206 may be configured to format
     (e.g., demodulate) a signal received from the later connected circuitry
     in a format compatible with transponder 114 for transmitting to RFID
     reader 104 via antenna 202. For example, where transponder 114 is of the
     13.56 MHz variety, modulator/demodulator 206 may be ISO/IEC 14443-2
     compliant.
<BR><BR>[0056] Modulator/demodulator 206 may be coupled to a protocol/sequence
     controller 208 for facilitating control of the authentication of the
     signal provided by RFID reader 104, and for facilitating control of the
     sending of the fob 102 account number. In this regard, protocol/sequence
     controller 208 may be any suitable digital or logic driven circuitry
     capable of facilitating determination of the sequence of operation for
     the fob 102 inner-circuitry. For example, protocol/sequence controller
     208 may be configured to determine whether the signal provided by the
     RFID reader 104 is authenticated, and thereby providing to the RFID
     reader 104 the account number stored on fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0057] Protocol/sequence controller 208 may be further in communication
     with authentication circuitry 210 for facilitating authentication of the
     signal provided by RFID reader 104. Authentication circuitry may be
     further in communication with a nonvolatile secure memory database 212.
     Secure memory database 212 may be any suitable elementary file system
     such as that defined by ISO/IEC 7816-4 or any other elementary file
     system allowing a lookup of data to be interpreted by the application on
     the chip. Database 212 may be any type of database, such as relational,
     hierarchical, object-oriented, and/or the like. Common database products
     that may be used to implement the databases include DB2 by IBM (White
     Plains, N.Y.), any of the database products available from Oracle
     Corporation (Redwood Shores, Calif.), Microsoft Access or MSSQL by
     Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.), or any other database product.
     Database 212 may be organized in any suitable manner, including as data
     tables or lookup tables. Association of certain data may be accomplished
     through any data association technique known and practiced in the art.
     For example, the association may be accomplished either manually or
     automatically. Automatic association techniques may include, for example,
     a database search, a database merge, GREP, AGREP, SQL, and/or the like.
     The association step may be accomplished by a database merge function,
     for example, using a "key field" in each of the manufacturer and retailer
     data tables. A "key field" partitions the database according to the
     high-level class of objects defined by the key field. For example, a
     certain class may be designated as a key field in both the first data
     table and the second data table., and the two data tables may then be
     merged on the basis of the class data in the key field. In this
     embodiment, the data corresponding to the key field in each of the merged
     data tables is preferably the same. However, data tables having similar,
     though not identical, data in the key fields may also be merged by using
     AGREP, for example.
<BR><BR>[0058] The data may be used by protocol/sequence controller 208 for data
     analysis and used for management and control purposes, as well as
     security purposes. Authentication circuitry may authenticate the signal
     provided by RFID reader 104 by association of the RFID signal to
     authentication keys stored on database 212. Encryption circuitry may use
     keys stored on database 212 to perform encryption and/or decryption of
     signals sent to or from the RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0059] In addition, protocol/sequence controller 208 may be in
     communication with a database 214 for storing at least a fob 102 account
     data, and a unique fob 102 identification code. Protocol/sequence
     controller 208 may be configured to retrieve the account number from
     database 214 as desired. Database 214 may be of the same configuration as
     database 212 described above. The fob account data and/or unique fob
     identification code stored on database 214 may be encrypted prior to
     storage. Thus, where protocol/sequence controller 208 retrieves the
     account data, and or unique fob identification code from database 214,
     the account number may be encrypted when being provided to RFID reader
     104. Further, the data stored on database 214 may include, for example,
     an unencrypted unique fob 102 identification code, a user identification,
     Track 1 and 2 data, as well as specific application applets.
<BR><BR>[0060] Fob 102 may be configured to respond to multiple interrogation
     frequency transmissions provided by RFID reader 104. That is, as
     described more fully below, RFID reader 104 may provide more than one RF
     interrogation signal. In this case, fob 102 may be configured to respond
     to the multiple frequencies by including in fob 102 one or more
     additional RF signal receiving/transmitting units 226. RF signal
     receiving/transmitting unit 226 may include an antenna 218 and
     transponder 220 where the antenna 218 and transponder 220 are compatible
     with at least one of the additional RF signals provided by RFID reader
     104. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may include a 134
     KHz antenna 218 configured to communicate with a 134 KHz transponder 220.
     In this exemplary configuration, an ISO/IEC 14443-2 compliant
     modulator/demodulator may not be required. Instead, the 134 KHz
     transponder may be configured to communicate directly with the
     protocol/sequence controller 208 for transmission and receipt of
     authentication and account number signals as described above.
<BR><BR>[0061] In another embodiment, fob 102 may further include a universal
     serial bus (USB) connector 132 for interfacing fob 102 to a user
     interface 134. User interface 134 may be further in communication with a
     POS device 110 via a network 136. Network 136 may be the Internet, an
     intranet, or the like as is described above with respect to network 112.
     Further, the user interface 134 may be similar in construction to any
     conventional input devices and/or computing systems aforementioned for
     permitting the system user to interact with the system. In one exemplary
     embodiment, fob 102 may be configured to facilitate online Internet
     payments. A USB converter 222 may be in communication with a USB
     connector 232 for facilitating the transfer of information between the
     modulator/demodulator 206 and USB connector 132. Alternatively, USB
     converter 222 may be in communication with protocol/sequence controller
     208 to facilitate the transfer of information between protocol/sequence
     controller 208 and USB connector 132.
<BR><BR>[0062] Where fob 102 includes a USB connector 132, fob 102 may be in
     communication with, for example, a USB port on user interface 134. The
     information retrieved from fob 102 may be compatible with credit card
     and/or smart card technology enabling usage of interactive applications
     on the Internet. No RFID reader may be required in this embodiment since
     the connection to POS device 110 may be made using a USB port on user
     interface 134 and a network 136.
<BR><BR>[0063] Fob 102 may include means for enabling activation of the fob by the
     user. In one exemplary embodiment, a switch 230 which may be operated by
     the user of the fob 102. The switch 230 on fob 102 may be used to
     selectively or inclusively activate the fob 102 for particular uses. In
     this context, the term "selectively" may mean that the switch 230 enables
     the user to place the fob 102 in a particular operational mode. For
     example, the user may place the fob 102 in a mode for enabling purchase
     of a good or of a service using a selected account number. Alternatively,
     the fob may be placed in a mode as such that the fob account number is
     provided by USB port 132 (or serial port) only and the fob transponder
     114 is disabled. In addition, the term "inclusively" may mean that the
     fob 102 is placed in an operational mode permitting the fob 102 to be
     responsive to the RF interrogation and interrogation via the USB
     connector 132. In one particular embodiment, the switch 230 may remain in
     an OFF position ensuring that one or more applications or accounts
     associated with the fob 102 are non-reactive to any commands issued by
     RFID reader 104. As used herein, the OFF position may be termed the
     "normal" position of the activation switch 230, although other normal
     positions are contemplated.
<BR><BR>[0064] In another exemplary embodiment, when the switch 230 is moved from
     the OFF position, the fob 102 may be deemed activated by the user. That
     is, the switch 230 may activate internal circuitry in fob 102 for
     permitting the fob to be responsive to RF signals (e.g., commands from
     RFID reader 104). In this way, switch 230 may facilitate control of the
     active and inactive states of the fob 102. Such control increases the
     system security by preventing inadvertent or illegal use of the fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0065] In one exemplary embodiment, switch 230 may be a simple mechanical
     device in communication with circuitry which may electrically prevent the
     fob from being powered by a RFID reader. That is, when switch 230 is in
     its normal position, switch 230 may provide a short to the fob 102
     internal circuitry, preventing fob 102 from being responsive to
     interrogation by RF or via the USB connector 230. In this arrangement,
     the switch 230 may be, for example, a "normally closed" (NC) configured
     switch, which may be electrically connected to the antenna 202 at the
     interface of the antenna 202 and the transponder 114. The switch 230 may
     be depressed, which may open the switch 230 fully activating the antenna
     202.
<BR><BR>[0066] In yet another exemplary embodiment, the fob 102 may include a
     biometric sensor and biometric membrane configured to operate as switch
     230 and activate the fob 102 when provided biometric signal from the fob
     102 user. Such biometric signal may be the digital reading of a
     fingerprint, thumbprint, or the like. Typically, where biometric
     circuitry is used, the biometric circuitry may be powered by an internal
     voltage source (e.g., battery). In this case, the switch may not be a
     simple mechanical device, but a switch which is powered. In yet another
     exemplary embodiment, switch 230 may be battery powered though no
     biometric circuitry is present in the fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0067] In yet another embodiment, the switch 230 may be a logic switch.
     Where switch 230 is a logic switch the switch 230 control software may be
     read from the sequence controller 208 to selectively control the
     activation of the various fob 102 components.
<BR><BR>[0068] FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of a RFID reader 104
     in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. RFID
     reader 104 includes, for example, an antenna 106 coupled to a RF module
     302, which is further coupled to a control module 304. In addition, RFID
     reader 104 may include an antenna 108 positioned remotely from the RFID
     reader 104 and coupled to RFID reader 104 via a suitable cable 120, or
     other wire or wireless connection.
<BR><BR>[0069] RF module 302 and antenna 106 may be suitably configured to
     facilitate communication with fob 102. Where fob 102 is formatted to
     receive a signal at a particular RF frequency, RF module 302 may be
     configured to provide an interrogation signal at that same frequency. For
     example, in one exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may be configured to
     respond to an interrogation signal of about 13.56 MHz. In this case, RFID
     antenna 106 may be 13 MHz and may be configured to transmit an
     interrogation signal of about 13.56 MHz. That is, fob 102 may be
     configured to include a first and second RF module (e.g., transponder)
     where the first module may operate using a 134 kHz frequency and the
     second RF module may operate using a 13.56 MHz frequency. The RFID reader
     104 may include two receivers which may operate using the 134 kHz
     frequency, the 13.56 MHz frequency or both. When the reader 104 is
     operating at 134 kHz frequency, only operation with the 134 kHz module on
     the fob 102 may be possible. When the reader 104 is operating at the
     13.56 MHz frequency, only operation with the 13.56 MHz module on the fob
     102 may be possible. Where the reader 104 supports both a 134 kHz
     frequency and a 13.56 MHz RF module, the fob 102 may receive both signals
     from the reader 104. In this case, the fob 102 may be configured to
     prioritize selection of the one or the other frequency and reject the
     remaining frequency. Alternatively, the reader 104 may receive signals at
     both frequencies from the fob upon interrogation. In this case, the
     reader 104 may be configured to prioritize selection of one or the other
     frequency and reject the remaining frequency.
<BR><BR>[0070] Further, protocol/sequence controller 314 may include an optional
     feedback function for notifying the user of the status of a particular
     transaction. For example, the optional feedback may be in the form of an
     LED, LED screen and/or other visual display which is configured to light
     up or display a static, scrolling, flashing and/or other message and/or
     signal to inform the fob 102 user that the transaction is initiated
     (e.g., fob is being interrogated), the fob is valid (e.g., fob is
     authenticated), transaction is being processed, (e.g., fob account number
     is being read by RFID reader) and/or the transaction is accepted or
     denied (e.g., transaction approved or disapproved). Such an optional
     feedback may or may not be accompanied by an audible indicator (or may
     present the audible indicator singly) for informing the fob 102 user of
     the transaction status. The audible feedback may be a simple tone,
     multiple tones, musical indicator, and/or voice indicator configured to
     signify when the fob 102 is being interrogated, the transaction status,
     or the like.
<BR><BR>[0071] RFID antenna 106 may be in communication with a transponder 306 for
     transmitting an interrogation signal and receiving at least one of an
     authentication request signal and/or an account data from fob 102.
     Transponder 306 may be of similar description as transponder 114 of FIG.
     2. In particular, transponder 306 may be configured to send and/or
     receive RF signals in a format compatible with antenna 202 in similar
     manner as was described with respect to fob transponder 114. For example,
     where transponder 306 is 13.56 MHz RF rated antenna 202 may be 13.56 MHz
     compatible. Similarly, where transponder 306 is ISO/IEC 14443 rated,
     antenna 106 may be ISO/IEC 14443 compatible.
<BR><BR>[0072] RF module 302 may include, for example, transponder 306 in
     communication with authentication circuitry 308 which may be in
     communication with a secure database 310. Authentication circuitry 308
     and database 310 may be of similar description and operation as described
     with respect to authentication circuitry 210 and secure memory database
     212 of FIG. 2. For example, database 310 may store data corresponding to
     the fob 102 which are authorized to transact business over system 100.
     Database 310 may additionally store RFID reader 104 identifying
     information for providing to fob 102 for use in authenticating whether
     RFID reader 104 is authorized to be provided the fob account number
     stored on fob database 214.
<BR><BR>[0073] Authentication circuitry 308 may be of similar description and
     operation as authentication circuitry 210. That is, authentication
     circuitry 308 may be configured to authenticate the signal provided by
     fob 102 in similar manner that authentication circuitry 210 may be
     configured to authenticate the signal provided by RFID reader 104. As is
     described more fully below, fob 102 and RFID reader 104 engage in mutual
     authentication. In this context, "mutual authentication" may mean that
     operation of the system 100 may not take place until fob 102
     authenticates the signal from RFID reader 104, and RFID reader 104
     authenticates the signal from fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0074] FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary authentication process in
     accordance with the present invention. The authentication process is
     depicted as one-sided. That is, the flowchart depicts the process of the
     RFID reader 104 authenticating the fob 102, although similar steps may be
     followed in the instance that fob 102 authenticates RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0075] As noted, database 212 may store security keys for encrypting or
     decrypting signals received from RFID reader 104. In an exemplary
     authentication process, where RFID reader 104 is authenticating fob 102,
     RFID reader 104 may provide an interrogation signal to fob 102 (step
     402). The interrogation signal may include a random code generated by the
     RFID reader authentication circuit 210, which is provided to the fob 102
     and which is encrypted using an unique encryption key corresponding to
     the fob 102 unique identification code. For example, the
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may provide a command to activate the
     authentication circuitry 308. Authentication circuitry 308 may provide
     from database 310 a fob interrogation signal including a random number as
     a part of the authentication code generated for each authentication
     signal. The authentication code may be an alphanumeric code which is
     recognizable (e.g., readable) by the RFID reader 104 and the fob 102. The
     authentication code may be provided to the fob 102 via the RFID RF
     interface 306 and antenna 106 (or alternatively antenna 108).
<BR><BR>[0076] Fob 102 receives the interrogation signal (step 404). The
     interrogation signal including the authorization code may be received at
     the RF interface 114 via antenna 202. Once the fob 102 is activated, the
     interrogation signal including the authorization code may be provided to
     the modulator/demodulator circuit 206 where the signal may be demodulated
     prior to providing the signal to protocol/sequence controller 208.
     Protocol/sequence controller 208 may recognize the interrogation signal
     as a request for authentication of the fob 102, and provide the
     authentication code to authentication circuit 210. The fob 102 may then
     encrypt the authentication code (step 406). In particular, encryption may
     be done by authentication circuit 210, which may receive the
     authentication code and encrypt the code prior to providing the encrypted
     authentication code to protocol/sequence controller 208. Fob 102 may then
     provide the encrypted authentication code to the RFID reader 104 (step
     408). That is, the encrypted authentication code may be provided to the
     RFID reader 104 via modulator/demodulator circuit 206, RF interface 114
     (e.g., transponder 114) and antenna 202.
<BR><BR>[0077] RFID reader 104 may then receive the encrypted authentication code
     and decryption it (step 410). That is, the encrypted authentication code
     may be received at antenna 106 and RF interface 306 and may be provided
     to authentication circuit 308. Authentication circuit 308 may be provided
     a security authentication key (e.g., transponder system decryption key)
     from database 310. The authentication circuit may use the authentication
     key to decrypt (e.g., unlock) the encrypted authorization code. The
     authentication key may be provided to the authentication circuit based on
     the fob 102 unique identification code. For example, the encrypted
     authentication code may be provided along with the unique fob 102
     identification code. The authentication circuit may receive the fob 102
     unique identification code and retrieve from the database 310 a
     transponder system decryption key correlative to the unique fob 102
     identification code for use in decrypting the encrypted authentication
     code.
<BR><BR>[0078] Once the authentication code is decrypted, the decrypted
     authentication code is compared to the authentication code provided by
     the RFID reader 104 at step 402 (step 412) to verify its authenticity. If
     the decrypted authorization code is not readable (e.g., recognizable) by
     the authentication circuit 308, the fob 102 is deemed to be unauthorized
     (e.g., unverified) (step 416) and the operation of system 100 is
     terminated (step 418). Contrarily, if the decrypted authorization code is
     recognizable (e.g., verified) by the fob 102, the decrypted authorization
     code is deemed to be authenticated (step 412), and the transaction is
     allowed to proceed (step 414). In one particular embodiment, the
     proceeding transaction may mean that the fob 102 may authenticate the
     RFID reader 104 prior to the RFID reader 104 authenticating fob 102,
     although, it should be apparent that the RFID reader 104 may authenticate
     the fob 102 prior to the fob 102 authenticating the RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0079] It should be noted that in an exemplary verification process, the
     authorization circuit 308 may determine whether the unlocked
     authorization code is identical to the authorization code provided in
     step 402. If the codes are not identical then the fob 102 is not
     authorized to access system 100. Although, the verification process is
     described with respect to identicality, identicality is not required. For
     example, authentication circuit 308 may verify the decrypted code through
     any protocol, steps, or process for determining whether the decrypted
     code corresponds to an authorized fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0080] Authentication circuitry 308 may additionally be in communication
     with a protocol/sequence controller 314 of similar operation and
     description as protocol/sequence controller 208 of FIG. 2. That is,
     protocol/sequence device controller 314 may be configured to determine
     the order of operation of the RFID reader 104 components. For example,
     FIG. 5 illustrates and exemplary decision process under which
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may operate. Protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the different components of RFID reader 104
     based on whether a fob 102 is present (step 502). For example, if a fob
     102 is not present, then protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the
     RFID reader 104 to provide an uninterrupted interrogation signal (step
     504). That is, the protocol/sequence controller may command the
     authentication circuit 308 to provide an uninterrupted interrogation
     signal until the presence of a fob 102 is realized. If a fob 102 is
     present, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID reader
     104 to authenticate the fob 102 (step 506).
<BR><BR>[0081] As noted above, authentication may mean that the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the authentication circuit 308 to provide fob
     102 with an authorization code. If a response is received from fob 102,
     protocol/sequence controller may determine if the response is a response
     to the RFID reader 104 provided authentication code, or if the response
     is a signal requiring authentication (step 508). If the signal requires
     <B><I>authentication, then the protocol</I></B>/sequence controller 314 may activate
     the authentication circuit as described above (step 506). On the other
     hand, if the fob 102 signal is a response to the provided authentication
     code, then the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID
     reader 104 to retrieve the appropriate security key for enabling
     recognition of the signal (step 510). That is, the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the authentication circuit 308 to retrieve
     from database 310 a security key (e.g., transponder system decryption
     key), unlock the signal, and compare the signal to the signal provided by
     the RFID reader 104 in the authentication process (e.g., step 506). If
     the signal is recognized, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may
     determine that the fob 102 is authorized to access the system 100. If the
     signal is not recognized, then the fob 102 is considered not authorized.
     In which case, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID
     controller to interrogate for authorized fobs (step 504).
<BR><BR>[0082] Once the protocol/sequence controller determines that the fob 102
     is authorized, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may seek to determine
     if additional signals are being sent by fob 102 (step 514). If no
     additional signal is provided by fob 102, then the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may provide all the components of RFID reader 104 to
     remain idle until such time as a signal is provided (step 516).
     Contrarily, where an additional fob 102 signal is provided, the
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may determine if the fob 102 is
     requesting access to the merchant point of sale terminal 110 (e.g., POS
     device) or if the fob 102 is attempting to interrogate the RFID reader
     104 for return (e.g., mutual) authorization (step 518). Where the fob 102
     is requesting access to a merchant point of sale terminal 110, the
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID reader 104 to open
     communications with the point of sale terminal 110 (step 524). In
     particular, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the point of
     sale terminal communications interface 312 to become active, permitting
     transfer of data between the RFID reader 104 and the merchant point of
     sale terminal 110.
<BR><BR>[0083] On the other hand, if the protocol/sequence controller determines
     that the fob 102 signal is a mutual interrogation signal, then the
     protocol/sequence controller may command the RFID reader 104 to encrypt
     the signal (step 520). The protocol/sequence controller 314 may command
     the encryption authentication circuit 318 to retrieve from database 320
     the appropriate encryption key in response to the fob 102 mutual
     interrogation signal. The protocol/sequence controller 314 may then
     command the RFID reader 104 to provide the encrypted mutual interrogation
     signal to the fob 102. The protocol/sequence controller 314 may command
     the authentication circuit 318 to provide an encrypted mutual
     interrogation signal for the fob 102 to mutually authenticate. Fob 102
     may then receive the encrypted mutual interrogation signal and retrieve
     from authentication circuitry 212 a RFID reader decryption key.
<BR><BR>[0084] Although an exemplary decision process of protocol/sequence
     controller 314 is described, it should be understood that a similar
     decision process may be undertaken by protocol/sequence controller 208 in
     controlling the components of fob 102. Indeed, as described above,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may have similar operation and design as
     protocol/sequence controller 208. In addition, to the above,
     protocol/sequence controllers 208 and 314 may incorporate in the decision
     process appropriate commands for enabling USB interfaces 222 and 316,
     when the corresponding device is so connected.
<BR><BR>[0085] Encryption/decryption component 318 may be further in communication
     with a secure account number database 320 which stores the security keys
     necessary for decrypting the encrypted fob account number. Upon
     appropriate request from protocol/sequence controller 314,
     encryption/decryption component (e.g., circuitry 318) may retrieve the
     appropriate security key, decrypt the fob account number and forward the
     decrypted account number to protocol sequence controller 314 in any
     format readable by any later connected POS device 110. In one exemplary
     embodiment, the account number may be forwarded in a conventional
     magnetic stripe format compatible with the ISO/IEC 7813 standard. That
     is, in accordance with the invention, there is no need to translate or
     correlate the account number to traditional magnetic stripe format as is
     done with the prior art. The invention processes the transaction request
     directly, as if the card associated with the account has been presented
     for payment.
<BR><BR>[0086] Upon receiving the account number in magnetic stripe format,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may forward the account number to POS
     device 110 via a communications interface 312 and data link 122, as best
     shown in FIG. 1. POS device 110 may receive the decrypted account number
     and forward the magnetic stripe formatted account number to a merchant
     network 112 for processing under the merchant's business as usual
     standard. In this way, the present invention eliminates the need of a
     third-party server. Further, where the POS device 110 receives a response
     from network 112 (e.g., transaction authorized or denied),
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may provide the network response to the
     RF module 302 for optically and/or audibly communicating the response to
     the fob 102 user.
<BR><BR>[0087] RFID reader 104 may additionally include a USB interface 316, in
     communication with the protocol/sequence controller 314. In one
     embodiment, the USB interface may be a RS22 serial data interface.
     Alternatively, the RFID reader 104 may include a serial interface such
     as, for example, a RS232 interface in communication with the
     protocol/sequence controller 314. The USB connector 316 may be in
     communication with a personalization system 116 (shown in FIG. 1B) for
     initializing RFID reader 104 to system 100 application parameters. That
     is, prior to operation of system 100, RFID reader 104 may be in
     communication with personalization system 116 for populating database 310
     with a listing of security keys belonging to authorized fobs 102, and for
     populating database 320 with the security keys to decrypt the fob 102
     account numbers placing the account numbers in ISO/IEC 7813 format. In
     this way, RFID reader 104 may be populated with a unique identifier
     (e.g., serial number) which may be used by fob authentication circuitry
     210 to determine if RFID reader 104 is authorized to receive a fob 102
     encrypted account number.
<BR><BR>[0088] FIG. 1B illustrates an exemplary personalization system 10B, in
     accordance with the present invention. In general, typical
     personalization system 100B may be any system for initializing the RFID
     reader 104 and fob 102 for use in system 100A. With reference to FIG. 1B,
     the similar personalization process for fob 102 may be illustrated. For
     example, personalization system 116 may be in communication with fob 102
     via RF ISO 14443 interface 114 for populating fob database 212 with the
     security keys for facilitating authentication of the unique RFID reader
     104 identifier. In addition, personalization system 116 may populate on
     database 212 a unique fob 102 identifier for use by RFID reader 104 in
     determining whether fob 102 is authorized to access system 100.
     Personalization system 116 may populate (e.g., inject) the encrypted fob
     102 account number into fob database 214 for later providing to an
     authenticated RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0089] In one exemplary embodiment, personalization system 116 may include
     any standard computing system as described above. For example,
     personalization system 116 may include a standard personal computer
     containing a hardware security module operable using any conventional
     graphic user interface. Prior to populating the security key information
     account number and unique identifying information into the fob 102 or
     RFID reader 104, the hardware security module may authenticate the fob
     102 and RFID reader 104 to verify that the components are authorized to
     receive the secure information.
<BR><BR>[0090] FIGS. 6A-B illustrate an exemplary flowchart of a personalization
     procedure which may be used to personalize fob 102 and/or RFID reader
     104. Although the following description discusses mainly personalization
     of fob 102, RFID reader 104 may be personalized using a similar process.
     The personalization process, which occurs between the personalization
     system 116 and the device to be personalized (e.g., fob 102 or RFID
     reader 104), may begin, for example at step 602. Mutual authentication
     may occur between the personalization system 116 and the device to be
     authenticated in much the same manner as was described above with regard
     to fob 102 mutually authenticating with RFID reader 104. That is,
     personalization system 116 may transmit a personalization system 116
     identifier to the device to be authenticated which is compared by the
     device authentication circuitry 210, 308 against personalization system
     identifiers stored in the device database 212, 310. Where a match does
     not occur (step 604), the personalization process may be aborted (step
     612). Where a match occurs (step 604), the personalization system may
     prepare a personalization file to be provided to the device to be
     personalized (step 606). If the personalization system is operated
     manually, the personalization file may be entered into the
     personalization system 116 using any suitable system interface such as,
     for example, a keyboard (step 606). Where the personalization system 116
     operator elects to delay the preparation of the personalization files,
     the system 116 may abort the personalization process (step 610). In this
     context, the personalization file may include the unique fob 102 or RFID
     reader 104 identifier, security key for loading into database 212 and
     310, and/or security keys for decrypting a fob account number which may
     be loaded in database 320.
<BR><BR>[0091] Fob 102 may be personalized by direct connection to the
     personalization system 116 via RF ISO/IEC 14443 interface 114, or the fob
     102 may be personalized using RFID reader 104. Personalization system 116
     and RFID reader 104 may engage in mutual authentication and RFID reader
     104 may be configured to transmit the fob personalization file to fob 102
     via RF. Once the fob 102 is presented to RFID reader 104 (steps 608, 614)
     for personalization, fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may engage in mutual
     authentication (step 614). Where the fob 102 is not presented to the RFID
     reader 104 for personalization, the personalization process may be
     aborted (step 610).
<BR><BR>[0092] If the fob 102 is detected, the personalization system 116 may
     create as a part of the personalization file, a unique identifier for
     providing to the fob 102 (step 616). The identifier is unique in that one
     identifier may be given only to a single fob. That is, no other fob may
     have that same identifier. The fob may then be configured and loaded with
     that identifier (step 618).
<BR><BR>[0093] The encrypted fob 102 account number may be populated into fob 102
     in the same manner as is described with respect to the fob 102 unique
     identifier. That is, personalization system 116 may pre-encrypt the
     account data (step 640) and inject the encrypted account into fob
     database 214 (step 622). The encrypted account data may be loaded (e.g.,
     injected) into the fob 102 using RFID reader 104 as discussed above.
<BR><BR>[0094] Once the personalization file is populated into the fob 102, the
     populated information is irreversibly locked to prevent alteration,
     unauthorized reading and/or unauthorized access (step 624).
     Personalization system 116 may then create a log of the personalization
     file information for later access and analysis by the personalization
     system 116 user (step 626).
<BR><BR>[0095] It should be noted that in the event the personalization process is
     compromised or interrupted (step 628), the personalization system 116 may
     send a security alert to the user (step 630) and the personalization
     process may be aborted (step 612). On the other hand, where no such
     compromising or interruption exists, the personalization system 116 may
     be prepared to begin initialization on a second device to be personalized
     (step 632).
<BR><BR>[0096] FIGS. 7A-B illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a
     personalization process which may be used to personalize RFID reader 104.
     RFID reader 104 may be in communication with a personalization system 116
     via RFID reader USB connection 316 (step 702). Once connected,
     personalization system 116 may establish communications with the RFID
     reader 104 and RFID reader 104 may provide personalization system 116 any
     RFID reader 104 identification data presently stored on the RFID reader
     104 (step 704). In accordance with step 708, where the RFID reader 104 is
     being personalized for the first time (step 706) the RFID reader 104 and
     the personalization system 116 may engage in mutual authentication as
     described above with respect to FIGS. 6A-B. After the mutual
     authentication is complete, personalization system 116 may verify that
     RFID reader 104 is properly manufactured or configured to operate within
     system 100. The verification may include evaluating the operation of the
     RFID reader 104 by determining if the RFID reader will accept
     predetermined default settings. That is, the personalization system 116
     may then provide the RFID reader 104 a set of default settings (step 708)
     and determine if the RFID reader 104 accepts those settings (step 712).
     If RFID reader 104 does not accept the default settings, personalization
     system 116 may abort the personalization process (step 714).
<BR><BR>[0097] If the personalization system 116 determines that the
     personalization process is not the first personalization process
     undertaken by the RFID reader 104 (step 706), personalization system 116
     and RFID reader 104 may engage in a mutual authentication process using
     the existing security keys already stored on RFID reader 104 (step 710).
     If authentication is unsuccessful (step 712), the personalization system
     116 may abort the personalization process (step 714).
<BR><BR>[0098] Where the personalization system 116 and the RFID reader 104
     successfully mutually authenticate, the personalization system 116 may
     update the RFID reader 104 security keys (step 716). Updating the
     security keys may take place at any time as determined by a system 100
     manager. The updating may take place as part of a routine maintenance or
     merely to install current security key data. The updating may be
     performed by downloading firmware into RFID reader 104 (step 718). In the
     event that the personalization system 116 determines in step 706 that the
     RFID reader 104 is undergoing an initial personalization, the firmware
     may be loaded into the RFID reader 104 for the first time. In this
     context, "firmware" may include any file which enables the RFID reader
     102 to operate under system 100 guidelines. For example, such guidelines
     may be directed toward the operation of RFID reader protocol/sequence
     controller 314.
<BR><BR>[0099] Personalization system 116 may then determine if the
     personalization keys (e.g., security keys, decryption keys, RFID
     identifier) need to be updated or if the RFID reader 104 needs to have an
     initial installation of the personalization keys (step 720). If so, then
     personalization system 116 may download the personalization keys as
     appropriate (step 722).
<BR><BR>[0100] Personalization system 116 may then check the RFID reader 104 to
     determine if the fob 102 identifiers and corresponding security keys
     should be updated or initially loaded (step 724). If no updating is
     necessary the personalization system 116 may end the personalization
     procedure (step 732). Contrarily, if the personalization system 116
     determines that the fob 102 identifiers and corresponding keys need to be
     updated or installed, the personalization system 116 may download the
     information onto RFID reader 104 (step 726). The information (e.g., fob
     security keys and identifiers) may be downloaded in an encrypted format
     and the RFID reader 104 may store the information in the RFID reader
     database 310 as appropriate (step 728). The personalization system 116
     may then create or update a status log cataloging for later use and
     analysis by the personalization system 116 user (step 730). Upon updating
     the status log, the personalization process may be terminated (step 732).
<BR><BR>[0101] It should be noted that, in some instances it may be necessary to
     repersonalize the RFID reader in similar manner as described above. In
     that instance, the personalization process described in FIGS. 7A and 7B
     may be repeated.
<BR><BR>[0102] FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for the operation of
     system 100A. The operation may be understood with reference to FIG. 1A,
     which depicts the elements of system 100A which may be used in an
     exemplary transaction. The process is initiated when a customer desires
     to present a fob 102 for payment (step 802). Upon presentation of the fob
     102, the merchant initiates the RF payment procedure via an RFID reader
     104 (step 804). In particular, the RFID reader sends out an interrogation
     signal to scan for the presence of fob 102 (step 806). The RF signal may
     be provided via the RFID reader antenna 106 or optionally via an external
     antenna 108. The customer then may present the fob 102 for payment (step
     808) and the fob 102 is activated by the RF interrogation signal
     provided.
<BR><BR>[0103] The fob 102 and the RFID reader 104 may then engage in mutual
     authentication (step 810). Where the mutual authentication is
     unsuccessful, an error message may be provided to the customer via the
     RFID optical and/or audible indicator (step 814) and the transaction may
     be aborted (step 816). Where the mutual authentication is successful
     (step 814), the RFID reader 104 may provide the customer with an
     appropriate optical and/or audible message (e.g., "transaction
     processing" or "wait") (step 818). The fob protocol/sequence controller
     208 may then retrieve from database 214 an encrypted fob account number
     and provide the encrypted account number to the RFID reader 104 (step
     820).
<BR><BR>[0104] The RFID reader 104 may then decrypt the account number and convert
     the account number into magnetic stripe (ISO/IEC 7813) format (step 822)
     and provide the unencrypted account number to the merchant system 130
     (step 828). In particular, the account number may be provided to the POS
     110 device for transmission to the merchant network 112 for processing.
     Exemplary processing methods according to the present invention are
     discussed with respect to FIGS. 10-13, shown below. Upon processing, the
     POS device 110 may then send an optical and/or audible transaction status
     message to the RFID reader 104 (step 830) for communication to the
     customer (step 832).
<BR><BR>[0105] The methods for processing the transactions may include one of
     several formats as required by the fob issuer. For example, one
     processing method may include processing the transaction under a
     preloaded fob format wherein a payment value (e.g., monetary value,
     reward points value, barter points value, etc.) may be preloaded into a
     preloaded value account or data file prior to permitting usage of the
     fob. In this way, the user may be permitted to set aside a payment amount
     for transactions for goods and services using the fob. During processing
     of the transaction, approval of the transaction may involve comparing the
     transaction amount to the amount stored (or remaining) in the preloaded
     value data file. Comparison may be made by a preloaded value processing
     system wherein the preloaded value processing system may compare the
     transaction amount to be processed to the preload value data file. Where
     the transaction amount exceeds the amount stored in the preloaded value
     account, the preloaded value processing system may deny authorization for
     completion of the transaction, request that the user increase the value
     in the data file, request another form of payment to satisfy all or a
     portion of the transaction amount, and/or any other means to satisfy the
     associated financial institution of payment. Where the transaction amount
     does not exceed the amount stored in the preloaded value data file
     account, the preloaded value processing system may provide for
     authorization of the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0106] An exemplary preloaded value processing system 1000 is shown with
     respect to FIG. 10. Preloaded value processing system 1000 may include a
     fob 102 including a transponder 114, which is in communication with a
     merchant system 130 via a RFID reader 104 or a computer interface 134 as
     is described with respect to FIG. 1A. The merchant system may be in
     communication with an issuer system 1010, where the issuer system 1010
     may be maintained by any entity (e.g., non-financial or financial
     institution, American Express.RTM.), Visa.RTM. and/or MasterCard.RTM.,
     etc.) which permits the fob 102 user to store a preload value amount in a
     preloaded value account (e.g., data file) maintained on an issuer
     database 1012 of similar construction as database 212. The issuer system
     1000 may further include one or more process servers for processing a fob
     transaction. As shown, a POS device 110 (included in merchant system 130)
     may be in communication with an issuer account server (IAS) 1014 for
     receiving the fob account information from POS device 110. IAS 1014 may
     be in further communication with a preloaded value authorization server
     (PLAS) 1016 for processing transactions involving a preloaded value fob.
     The PLAS 1016 may be in further communication with an issuer database
     1012 for retrieving funds from the preloaded value data file (not shown)
     which are used for satisfying the preloaded fob or merchant transaction
     request. In this instance, the preloaded value data file may be included
     on database 1012 as, for example, one or more subfiles.
<BR><BR>[0107] As used herein, the term "issuer" or "account provider" may refer
     to any entity facilitating payment of a transaction using a fob, and may
     include systems permitting payment using at least one of a preloaded and
     non-preloaded fob. Typical issuers may be, for example, American
     Express.RTM., MasterCard.RTM., Visa, Discover.RTM., and the like. In the
     preloaded value processing context, an exchange value (e.g., money,
     rewards points, barter points, etc.) may be stored in a preloaded value
     data file for use in completing a requested transaction. In one
     embodiment, the exchange value is not be stored on the fob itself.
     Further, the preloaded value data file may be debited the amount of the
     transaction, so the preloaded value account may be replenished. As
     described more fully below, the preloaded value system platform may be
     used to complete "direct link" transactions. In which case, the preloaded
     value account may function as a place holder and may store a zero value.
<BR><BR>[0108] The preloaded value data file may be any conventional data file
     configuration for storing a value (e.g., monetary, rewards points, barter
     points, etc.) which may be exchanged for goods or services. In that
     regard, the preloaded value data file may have any configuration as
     determined or desired by the issuer system 1010.
<BR><BR>[0109] In exemplary operation, fob identifying information (e.g., account
     number or fob marker) may be provided to the POS device 110 in similar
     manner as was discussed with respect to FIG. 1A. That is, the fob 102 may
     be presented to the merchant system 130 via a RFID reader 104 or a
     computer interface 134, which may provide the fob identifying information
     in Track 1 or Track 2 format, or any format recognizable by the POS
     device 110 and/or the issuer system 1001. A POS device 110 included in
     the merchant system 130 may receive the fob 102 identifying information
     and provide the fob 102 identifying information along with the
     transaction identifying information (e.g., amount, quantity, merchant
     identification, etc.) to the issuer system 1010 for authorization. The
     merchant system 130 may additionally include a merchant system marker or
     identifier for indicating a merchant system identity. The merchant system
     130 may combine the fob 102 identifying information, the merchant
     identifying information, and/or the transaction identifying information,
     into a merchant transaction request for providing to the issuer system
     1010.
<BR><BR>[0110] The IAS 1014 may receive the transaction and fob identifying
     information (or merchant transaction request) and suitably recognize that
     the transaction is being requested relative to a preloaded value account
     associated with a preloaded fob. That is, the IAS 1014 may recognize that
     the user has presented a preloaded fob 102 for payment. Recognition of
     the fob 102 as a preloaded fob may mean that the fob identifying
     information includes a marker or identifier indicating that the fob is
     associated with a preloaded value data file. Upon recognition of the
     marker, the IAS 1014 may forward transaction and fob identifying
     information to the PLAS 1016 for processing. PLAS 1016 may compare the
     transaction amount to the value stored or remaining in the preloaded
     value to determine if authorization should be granted or denied. Where
     the transaction amount exceeds the value stored in the preloaded value
     data file, the PLAS 1016 may forward a transaction denied message to the
     IAS 1014 for providing to the merchant system 130, or the PLAS may
     facilitate a request that the user increase the value in the data file,
     request another form of payment to satisfy all or a portion of the
     transaction amount, and/or any other means to satisfy the associated
     financial institution of current or future payment. Alternatively, where
     the transaction amount is less than or equal to the value stored in the
     preload value data file the PLAS 1016 may deduct from the preloaded value
     data file the necessary amount for satisfaction of the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0111] As noted above, in one exemplary embodiment of the present
     invention, the PLAS 1016 may provide a transaction denied message to the
     IAS 1014 for various financial security reasons, such as where the amount
     stored in the preloaded value account is less than required for
     satisfying the merchant or fob transaction request. In this instance,
     where the preloaded value falls below a predetermined minimum level
     (e.g., minimum depletion level), it may be necessary for the fob user to
     reload the preloaded value data file. Reloading of the preloaded value
     account may take place manually (e.g., by the fob user telephonically or
     online) or may take place automatically when the value stored in the
     preloaded value data file is depleted to a predefined level. Where the
     reloading is done automatically, reloading may occur under rules
     established by the fob issuer or owner. For example, reloading may occur
     at preselected time intervals, when the value stored is below a
     predetermined amount, until a maximum number of reloads in a
     predetermined time period has occurred or until a maximum reload amount
     is reached in a predetermined time period.
<BR><BR>[0112] In another exemplary operation, the processing system 1000 may be
     operated offline. For example, merchant system 130 may be offline with
     respect to issuer system 1010. That is, transactions may be approved at
     the merchant system 130, prior to the transaction identifying information
     being transferred to the issuer system. Instead, the merchant system 130
     may be provided an approval protocol for use in evaluating the merchant
     transaction request. For example, the approval protocol may provide for
     transaction approval where the transaction is below a certain amount,
     includes a particular merchant or goods or service, or is requested from
     a particular location or the like. Once the offline transaction is
     completed, the merchant may seek satisfaction of the transaction at a
     later time-period by submitting the transaction to the issuer
     individually, in batch, or under any submission processing determined by
     the merchant.
<BR><BR>[0113] For offline transactions, the fob 102 may include a counter (not
     shown) which may track the number of offline transactions. Once a
     predetermined number of transactions are attempted, the counter may be
     used to facilitate disenabling the fob 102 usage. At which point the fob
     102 user may be required to perform an online transaction whereby the
     counter may be reset, again permitting offline usage of the fob. As can
     be understood, requiring online usage following a predetermined number of
     offline usages may function as an additional security measure.
<BR><BR>[0114] FIGS. 11A and 11B depict exemplary preloading and reloading
     processes which may be performed in accordance with the present
     invention. The preloading and reloading processes may be preformed using
     one or more servers (e.g., PLAS 1016) in communication with a funding
     source 1104. Although the processes are demonstrated using a PLAS 1016,
     it is contemplated that any server configured for establishing and
     managing data files may be used. However, to facilitate further
     understanding of the invention, the preloading and reloading aspects of
     the invention are described with reference to PLAS 1016.
<BR><BR>[0115] PLAS 1016 may be used to establish on the server or on a database
     (e.g., database 1012) a preloaded value account (e,g, data file) (1106).
     The preload value account may be funded or maintained by a fob
     issuer/account provider which may establish a credit, charge, debit,
     rewards value account, loyalty account, or the like, in connection with a
     charge or credit card (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
     Discover, etc.), debit or direct debit authorization (DDA) system.
<BR><BR>[0116] The preloaded value account may be established to at least a
     predetermined minimum preload amount or value (e.g., minimum preload
     level) as determined by the account provider and/or the fob user or
     owner. In this context, the predetermined minimum value (e.g., minimum
     preload value) required to establish the preloaded value account may vary
     with respect to a particular fob user. The preloaded value account may be
     loaded (e.g., preloaded or reloaded) from funds received from one of a
     funding source 1104 (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, fuel
     cards, or the like). Further, the preloaded value account may be loaded
     with value received from loyalty or rewards points provider. To
     facilitate the understanding of the invention, the loyalty or rewards
     point provider may be referred to herein as a funding source. Thus, the
     PLAS 1016 may communicate with the funding source 1104 to obtain funds or
     value for loading and/or reloading the preloaded value account (1108).
<BR><BR>[0117] FIG. 11B shows an exemplary reloading process in accordance with
     the invention. During operation, a consumer may present to a merchant
     system 130 the prepaid fob 102 for purchasing goods or services (1110).
     The preloaded value account is then depleted the value amount paid to the
     merchant system 130. The process for purchasing goods may be repeated
     until the value stored in the preloaded value account equals or is less
     than a minimum level balance (e.g., minimum depletion level). The minimum
     depletion level may be predetermined by the fob user or fob issuer, and
     may be the minimum value permitted to be stored in the preloaded value
     account before the file is to be reloaded.
<BR><BR>[0118] Once the preloaded value data is depleted such that the minimum
     depletion level is reached, the PLAS 1016 may trigger an automatic reload
     to reload the preloaded value account from funds retrieved from the
     funding source 1104 (1112). The amount of funds retrieved may be
     sufficient for loading the preloaded value account to the minimum amount
     described above or to some other predetermined reload value. In one
     exemplary embodiment, the PLAS 1016 may trigger automatic reloading where
     a predetermined minimum depletion level (e.g., "minimum level balance")
     is reached. That is, the preloaded value account may not be entirely
     depleted to zero value before automatic reloading occurs. In this
     instance, the PLAS 1016 may charge the funding necessary for automatic
     reloading against the available funds at funding source 1104. In another
     exemplary embodiment, the automatic reloading may occur where the
     transaction exceeds the amount stored in or remaining in the preloaded
     value account. In this way, the preloaded value account may be restored
     to an amount necessary for completion of the transaction. For example,
     where automatic reloading restores the preloaded value account to a value
     suitable for transaction completion, the preloaded value account may be
     automatically reloaded prior to processing the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0119] In another exemplary embodiment, automatic reloading may occur
     based on different user or issuer automatic reload criteria. Other
     automatic reload criteria may include, but are not limited to, reloading
     until a defined maximum load amount in a defined time period is reached,
     reloading at a selected reoccurring time interval (e.g., once a month),
     reloading as permitted until a defined maximum number of reloads in a
     specified time period is reached, or reloading until a defined maximum
     reload amount is reached in a specified time period. In some instances,
     reloading may be accomplished manually, such as, for example, when the
     fob user contacts the issuer telephonically or via user interface to
     provide a specified funding criteria and funding source for use in
     reloading the preloaded value account.
<BR><BR>[0120] In yet another exemplary embodiment, the preloaded value
     transaction processing system may permit approval of a transaction where
     the transaction value exceeds the preloaded value amount stored in the
     preloaded value account. That is, the preloaded fob may be used for
     purchases exceeding the preloaded value amount provided that the charge
     submitted by the merchant is less than or equal to the maximum reload
     amount permitted plus the amount stored on the card at the time the
     charge is submitted.
<BR><BR>[0121] In another exemplary embodiment, the preloaded value system may
     approve transactions based on a particular merchant's transaction
     processing protocol. Where the issuer has reviewed and/or approved a
     merchant's transaction processing method, the system may take the method
     in consideration in determining whether to approve a merchant's
     transaction request. For example, a merchant's transaction processing
     method may include the merchant submitting transaction requests which
     exceed the preloaded value amount, but the actual charge may be less than
     or equal to the preloaded value amount. Under this transaction processing
     method a merchant, such as, for example, a gasoline merchant, may seek
     pre-approval of an anticipated gasoline fueling amount. Neither the
     consumer nor the merchant may know the exact final value of the purchase,
     especially, for example, where the consumer decides to fill his
     automobile gas tank or purchase non-fuel items. Thus, the merchant may
     submit a transaction request which may be higher than the final amount of
     the transaction. The merchant may submit the transaction request in
     real-time or at a later time period in a similar manner as is described
     above with respect to offline transaction request processing. In either
     on line or off line processing, the preloaded value transaction
     processing system may still be configured to approve the transaction
     request. The processing system may recognize that a transaction came from
     a particular merchant and institute a predetermined approval protocol
     correlative to that merchant, since the approval protocol may include
     information that the merchant is sending a transaction request exceeding
     the actual charge.
<BR><BR>[0122] The transaction processing system may use any one of the acceptable
     techniques for identifying merchants, such as recognition of the merchant
     ID, or a marker appended to the transaction, or the like. The processing
     system may correlate the merchant ID with a merchant protocol for
     requesting a transaction approval of an amount greater than the preloaded
     value (or reload value), and approve the merchant request accordingly.
<BR><BR>[0123] In accordance with an alternate exemplary embodiment of a preloaded
     value processing system 1000, upon receiving the transaction request from
     the IAS 1014, the PLAS 1016 may evaluate the transaction request based
     upon several risk criteria established by the issuer for either online or
     offline transactions. If all the criteria are successfully met, then the
     PLAS 1016 may send authorization of the transaction (e.g., "transaction
     granted") to the IAS 1014 for providing to the merchant system 130.
     Simultaneous with or subsequent to, providing the transaction
     authorization to the IAS 1014, the PLAS 1016 may seek satisfaction of the
     transaction from the fob value account maintained on the account provider
     database 1012. The transaction request may be provided to the IAS 1014
     for processing. That is, the IAS 1014 may seek to deduct the transaction
     value from the balance of the amount stored in the preloaded value
     account.
<BR><BR>[0124] FIG. 12 depicts an exemplary embodiment of another transaction
     processing system ("direct link" system) 1200 in accordance with the
     present invention. More particularly, FIG. 12 depicts a direct link
     system 1200 which may be used to process a merchant transaction request.
     In this context, a direct link system may be any system which facilitates
     satisfaction of a transaction request using a fob or other presentable
     medium (credit card, charge card, debit card, or the like) directly
     linked to an account which stores an exchange value (e.g., money, credit
     or charge, or rewards points, etc.). In this instance, the preloaded
     value account may not be preloaded as described above. Further, the
     preloaded value account may be linked to a contact financial product such
     as a credit, debit, and/or DDA card, and the like, which may be presented
     for payment of goods and services. In this regard, the fob (here called
     "direct link fob") and the card are associated with the same funding
     source and the user or merchant may seek satisfaction of a transaction
     from the funding source independent of whether the direct link fob or
     card is used. In the exemplary direct link system 1200, the direct link
     fob 102 user may not establish a preloaded value account with value.
     Instead, the preloaded value account may perpetually store a zero value
     or the fob 102 may be associated with a fob transaction account which may
     be used to provide payment to the merchant for goods and services where
     the account may be a credit, debit, loyalty account or the like.
<BR><BR>[0125] In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a
     transaction request associated with a direct link fob 102 may be
     processed using the preloaded value transaction system processing
     described above. However, as noted, in this instance the preloaded value
     account is used as a place holder storing a zero value. A transaction
     account containing a transaction account value which is associated with
     the direct link fob is treated as the funding source for satisfying
     direct link transactions. In this instance, the transaction may be
     satisfied according to a fob user or issuer predefined protocol or
     criteria.
<BR><BR>[0126] As shown, the merchant system 130 may be in communication with an
     issuer system 1010 for receiving a merchant transaction request. More
     particularly, the POS device 110 may be in communication with an issuer
     server, such as, for example, an issuer account server (IAS) 1014 for
     receiving the merchant and/or transaction identifying information. IAS
     1014 may be in further communication with a PLAS 1016 for processing the
     merchant transaction request. In some instances the PLAS 1016 may be in
     further communication with a second IAS 1202, although a second IAS 1202
     may not be required where one or more of the existing servers may perform
     the functions of IAS 1202 described below. However, the IAS 1202 is
     included herein to simplify the understanding the operation of this
     exemplary embodiment.
<BR><BR>[0127] In exemplary operation of system 1200, the direct link fob
     identifying information (e.g., fob identifier or account number) may be
     provided to the POS device 110 in similar manner as was discussed with
     respect to FIG. 1A. That is, the direct link fob 102 may be presented to
     the merchant system 130 via a RFID reader 104 or a computer interface
     134, which may provide the direct link fob 102 identifying information in
     Track 1 or Track 2 format. A POS device 110 included in the merchant
     system 130 may receive the direct link fob 102 identifying information
     and provide the direct link fob 102 identifying information along with
     the transaction identifying information (e.g., amount, quantity, merchant
     identification, etc.) to the issuer system 1010 for authorization.
<BR><BR>[0128] The IAS 1014 may receive the transaction and fob identifying
     information and recognize that the transaction as being requested
     relative to a direct link fob 102. Recognition of the direct link fob 102
     in this instance may mean that the direct link fob 102 identifying
     information includes a marker or identifier indicating that the fob is
     associated with a zero value preloaded value account. Upon recognition of
     the marker, the IAS 1014 may forward the transaction and fob identifying
     information to PLAS 1016 for processing.
<BR><BR>[0129] In similar manner as was described with respect to the operation of
     the preloaded value processing system of FIG. 10, the PLAS 1016 may
     evaluate the transaction request based upon several risk criteria
     established by the issuer. Exemplary risk criteria may include, but are
     not limited to, consideration of transaction amount limits for a
     specified time period, fob user usage history, fund or reserve limits,
     pre-determined re-funding rules, user defined limits, or any similar
     evaluative criteria. If all the criteria are successfully met, then the
     PLAS 1016 may send authorization of the transaction (e.g., "transaction
     granted") to the IAS 1014 for providing to the merchant system 130. The
     transaction authorization may be provided to the merchant system 130
     based on evaluation of the risk criteria and not upon the value present
     in preloaded value account or direct link transaction account storing
     value relative to the direct link fob.
<BR><BR>[0130] After providing the transaction authorization to the IAS 1014, the
     PLAS 1016 may seek authorization of the transaction against the direct
     link fob account (e.g., transaction account) which is maintained on the
     issuer database 1012, and which is funded by value received from a
     funding source 1104. The authorization request may be provided to the IAS
     1202 for approval which may retrieve the necessary value from the direct
     link fob account. For example, where the direct link fob account is a
     charge or credit account, the PLAS 1016 may request authorization from
     the second IAS 1202 and the IAS 1202 may assess the transaction amount
     against the direct link fob account on database 1012. The IAS 1202 may
     seek to record the amount of the transaction in the direct link fob usage
     history data file for payment at the end of a billing cycle (e.g., charge
     account), or the amount may be recorded on the fob direct link fob usage
     data file for payment at a date later than the end of the billing cycle
     (e.g., credit account).
<BR><BR>[0131] In an alternative operation the PLAS 1016 may assess the
     transaction amount against the direct link fob account, without use of a
     second IAS 1202. Whether the transaction is processed using a second IAS
     1202, it is to be understood that value may not be immediately
     transferred to the merchant system from the direct link fob account for
     satisfying the transaction. Instead, the direct link fob issuer may
     guarantee satisfaction of the merchant transaction by, for example,
     request until a certain value is retrieved from the direct link fob
     account at the end of the billing cycle or later. That is, the PLAS 1016
     may provide authorization of the transaction, but may not retrieve the
     necessary value for satisfying the transaction until after the merchant
     provides a request for settlement to the issuer system.
<BR><BR>[0132] In yet another exemplary transaction processing system 1300
     depicted in FIG. 13, the merchant system 130 may provide a batch file
     containing multiple fob transaction requests to be processed to a process
     server 1302 where the multiple fob transactions may include both
     preloaded value and direct link transaction request. The system 1300 may
     include a process server 1302 which distinguished between preloaded value
     and direct link transaction requests. That is, process server 1302 may be
     used for separating the fob transactions which are associated with a
     preloaded fob account and those that are not associated with a preloaded
     fob account, as discussed more fully below. The process server 1302 may
     further be in communication with an IAS 1014 for seeking settlement of
     the transaction. The IAS 1014 may process the transaction request in
     accordance with the direct link transaction process or the preloaded
     value transaction platform described above.
<BR><BR>[0133] In exemplary operation of system 1300, the process server 1302 may
     receive the settlement file and identify the files according to the
     nature of the transaction request. For example, the process server 1302
     may place markers on the files received and create sub-files of
     transaction requests relative to the type of fob used in the transaction
     (e.g., preloaded fob, and direct link fob associated with a charge or
     credit account). The process server may create the sub-files relative to
     the file markers. The process server 1302 may create a first fob
     transaction file for merchant payables and a second fob transaction file
     for accounts receivable to be forwarded to the IAS 1014 for processing.
     Where the sub-file includes merchant payable, the process server 1302 may
     provide funds to the merchant for payment of the transaction, where the
     funds provided may be equivalent to the transaction amount minus discount
     revenues. The funds may be retrieved from the funding source for
     providing to the merchant. Alternatively, the process server 1302 may
     create a second fob transaction file for accounts receivable payments and
     forwarded the second fob transaction file to the IAS 1014. IAS 1014 may
     then process the transaction request according to the processes described
     in FIGS. 10 and 12. That is, the IAS 1014 may distinguish the preloaded
     fob transaction requests from those associated with the direct link fob
     and process the transactions accordingly.
<BR><BR>[0134] Considering the operation of the various transaction processing
     systems described above, it can be seen that the transaction processing
     systems described may distinguish when a preloaded fob is used, when a
     card associated with a fob is used, or when an account associated with a
     preloaded fob is reloaded. In that regard, the present invention may be
     used to reward points depending on the nature of the fob usage. The
     points (e.g., loyalty points) may be stored in a points or rewards
     account maintained on the issuer database (e.g., database 1012). The
     rewards points may then later be redeemed from the rewards account for
     exchange for goods and services as desired by the fob user. For more
     information on loyalty systems and transaction systems, see, for example,

<BR><BR>[0135] As noted, in one instance, points may be provided when the fob is
     used in addition to when the card associated with the fob is used. For
     example, the IAS 1014 may recognize that a fob is being used and award
     points (e.g., loyalty points) to the rewards account assigned to the fob
     user or associated with the fob. The loyalty points may be awarded based
     on any criteria as determined by the fob issuer. Exemplary rewarding
     criteria may include rewarding points for, for example, frequency of fob
     usage, amount of individual purchase using the fob, the total amount of
     purchases in a given time period, location of merchant, type of merchant,
     or any such criteria for incenting fob usage.
<BR><BR>[0136] Where the fob is associated with a preloaded value account such as
     that described with respect to FIG. 10, points may be awarded for account
     reloading. That is, IAS 1014 may place award points in the rewards
     account relative to the amount loaded or reloaded as required. Further
     the IAS 1014 may place reward points in the rewards account relative to
     usage of the fob at a particular merchant or for a particular
     transaction.
<BR><BR>[0137] It should be noted that the transaction account associated with the
     fob 102 may include a usage restriction, such as, for example, a per
     purchase spending limit, a time of day use, a day of week use, certain
     merchant use and/or the like, wherein an additional verification is
     required when using the fob outside of the restriction. The restrictions
     may be personally assigned by the fob 102 user, or the account provider.
     For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the account may be established
     such that purchases above $X (i.e., the spending limit) must be verified
     by the customer. Such verification may be provided using a suitable
     personal identification number (PIN) which may be recognized by the fob
     102 or a payment authorization center (not shown) as being unique to the
     fob 102 holder (e.g., customer) and the correlative fob 102 transaction
     account number. Where the requested purchase is above the established per
     purchase spending limit, the customer may be required to provide, for
     example, a PIN, biometric sample and/or similar secondary verification to
     complete the transaction. That is, for example, the fob 102 may enter the
     unique PIN in a conventional keypad at the merchant system 130 or RFID
     reader 104. The PIN may be provided to the authorization center for
     comparison with a correlative PIN stored on the issuer system.
     Alternatively, the PIN may be provided to the fob 102 via the RFID reader
     104. The fob 102 may verify the PIN by comparing the PIN to a correlative
     PIN stored on, for example, secure memory 212.
<BR><BR>[0138] Where a verification PIN is used as secondary verification the
     verification PIN may be checked for accuracy against a corroborating PIN
     which correlates to the fob 102 transaction account number. The
     corroborating PIN may be stored locally (e.g., on the fob 102), or may be
     stored on a database (1012) at the payment authorization center. The
     payment authorization center database may be any database 1012 maintained
     and operated by the fob 102 transaction account provider.
<BR><BR>[0139] The verification PIN may be provided to the POS device 110 using a
     conventional merchant (e.g., POS) PIN key pad 118 in communication with
     the POS device 110 as shown in FIG. 1, or a RFID keypad in communication
     with the RFID reader 104. PIN keypad may be in communication with the POS
     device 110 (or alternatively, RFID reader 104) using any conventional
     data link described above. Upon receiving the verification PIN, the RFID
     reader 104 may seek to match the PIN to the corroborating PIN stored on
     the RFID reader 104 at database 310 or 320. Alternatively, the
     verification PIN may be provided to a payment authorization center to
     determine whether the PIN matches the PIN stored on the payment
     authorization center database which correlates to the fob 102 account. If
     a match is made, the purchase may no longer be restricted, and the
     transaction may be allowed to be completed.
<BR><BR>[0140] In an alternate embodiment, verification of purchases exceeding the
     established spending limit may involve biometrics circuitry included in
     fob 102. FIG. 9 is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary fob 102
     wherein fob 102 includes a biometric security system 902. Biometric
     security system 902 may include a biometric sensor 904 for sensing the
     fingerprint of the fob 102 user. The biometric sensor 902 may be in
     communication with a sensor interface/driver 906 for receiving the sensor
     fingerprint and activating the operation of fob 102. In communication
     with the biometric sensor 904 and sensor interface 906 may be a battery
     903 for providing the necessary power for operation of the biometric
     security system components.
<BR><BR>[0141] In one exemplary application of the fob 102 including the biometric
     security system 902, the customer may place his finger on the biometric
     sensor to initiate the mutual authentication process between the fob 102
     and the RFID reader 104, or to provide secondary verification of the
     user's identity. The sensor fingerprint may be digitized and compared
     against a digitized fingerprint stored in a database (e.g., security
     database 212) included on fob 102. Such comparison step may be controlled
     by protocol/sequence controller 208 and may be validated by
     authentication circuit 210. Where such verification is made, the mutual
     authentication between fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may begin, and the
     transaction may proceed accordingly. Alternatively, the comparison may be
     made with a digitized fingerprint stored on a database maintained by the
     fob 102 transaction account provider system (not shown). The digitized
     fingerprint may be verified in much the same way as is described above
     with respect to the PIN.
<BR><BR>[0142] In one exemplary application of the fob 102 including the biometric
     security system 902, the system 902 may be used to authorize a purchase
     exceeding the established per purchase spending limit. In this case,
     where the customer's intended purchase exceeds the spending limit, the
     customer may be asked to provide assurance that the purchase is
     authorized. Accordingly, the customer may provide such verification by
     placing his finger over the biometric sensor 904. The biometric sensor
     904 may then digitize the fingerprint and provide the digitized
     fingerprint for verification as described above. Once verified, fob 102
     may provide a transaction authorized signal to RF transponder 202 (or
     alternatively to transponder 220) for forwarding to RFID reader 104. RFID
     reader 104 may then provide the transaction authorized signal to the POS
     device 110 in similar manner as is done with convention PIN driven
     systems and the POS device 110 may process the transaction under the
     merchant's business as usual standard.
<BR><BR>[0143] In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention,
     the fob user is provided limited access to a fob user data file
     maintained on an issuer system for managing the fob usage and fob user
     information. User may have access over the phone, online, or off line.
     The fob user may access the fob user data file to change, for example,
     demographic information (e.g., fob user address, phone number, email
     address, or the like), the funding source (e.g., credit account, charge
     account, rewards account, barter account, etc.) associated with the fob,
     view the transaction history, etc. In addition, the fob user may be
     permitted to load or reload the account or alter automatic reload
     parameters (e.g., amount to reload, period for reloading, etc.). Where
     more than one fob 102 is correlated to a transaction account, the user
     may be provided similar access to the data files corresponding to the
     additional fobs.
<BR><BR>[0144] With reference to FIG. 1A, the fob user may connect the fob 102 to
     a computer interface 134 via the USB interface 132. The fob user may then
     use the computer interface 134 to access the fob user data file via the
     network 136. In particular, the network 136 may be in communication with
     an issuer system (e.g. system 1010 of FIG. 10) and may be provided
     limited access to an issuer server (e.g., server 1014) for managing the
     fob. The issuer server 1014 may be in communication with an issuer system
     database (e.g., 1012) which stores the information to be managed relative
     to the user fob user data file. The changes made to the fob user data
     file by the fob user may be made in real-time, after a brief delay, or
     after an extended delay. In one instance, changes may be stored in a
     batch changes file on the issuer database for later batch processing.
<BR><BR>[0145] The preceding detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the
     invention makes reference to the accompanying drawings, which show the
     exemplary embodiment by way of illustration. While these exemplary
     embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in

     example, the steps recited in any of the method or process claims may be
     executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented.
     Further, the present invention may be practiced using one or more
     servers, as necessary. Thus, the preceding detailed description is
     presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation, and
     the scope of the invention is defined by the preceding description, and
     with respect to the attached claims.
