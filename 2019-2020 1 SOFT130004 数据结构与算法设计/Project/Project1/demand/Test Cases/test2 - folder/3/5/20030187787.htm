<BR><BR>PRIORITY
<BR><BR>[0001] The present application claims priority to Provisional Application
     Serial No. 60/368,155, filed on Mar. 29, 2002.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002] The present invention relates generally to authentication tokens
     used for performing purchase transactions and other functionality, and
     more specifically to radio frequency identification devices for
     performing purchase transactions with an automobile as a trusted entity.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0003] Technologically new payments mechanisms have often been frustrated
     by the famous `chicken or the egg` conundrum. Until there are lots of
     consumers with the new devices, merchants are reluctant to pay the cost
     of installing new readers for the technology. Similarly, consumers are
     reluctant to carry new devices until there are enough merchants to accept
     them. Despite increasing fraud associated with criminals `stripping` the
     information from magnetic-stripe cards, the card associations have failed
     to deploy more secure alternatives. Smartcards are just one example of
     the devices that have failed to gain traction. The invention described
     here addresses this conundrum.
<BR><BR>[0004] RFID technology is very broadly used today. RFID devices are
     currently used to identify: cattle; packages; owners of vehicles and for
     payments (e.g. the 5 MM active Exxon Mobil SpeedPass users). The
     technology is available in two forms, active and passive RFID devices.
<BR><BR>[0005] E-Z Pass is an example of an active RFID device. In order to permit
     cars to be recognized at speeds up to 200 MPH, such active RFID devices
     have a battery and in response to a signal from readers, transmit a
     signal that can be recognized from a distance of 40 meters from the
     reader. At such distances, it is important that only the intended vehicle
     is charged for the toll. As a consequence, a lot of technology is focused
     on tracking a particular vehicle within a specific lane of traffic.
<BR><BR>[0006] One large implementation of RFID technology is connected to passive
     devices. Passive RFID devices have no battery. These devices contain
     chips and an antenna. When the passive RFID device is in proximity of a
     reader, usually within inches but can be feet away, the chip is activated
     by an RF signal sent by the reader. The reader's broadcast RF signal is
     captured by the passive device's antenna and generates sufficient
     electrical energy to activate the chip. The passive RFID chip is
     hardwired to respond in a particular way, to be recognized by the reader.
<BR><BR>[0007] Payments using RFID devices are beginning to emerge, though there
     are two impediments: merchants have balked at the $5,000-15,000 cost of
     installing RFID readers, because there are few RFID enabled consumers;
     and, issuers are reluctant to distribute tokens (at a cost of $8 each)
     unless there are enough merchants to generate sizeable payments.
<BR><BR>[0008] The leading RFID payments providers include EZPass, Speedpass,
     2Scoot and Freedompay. The primary goals for these entities are: to
     broaden as quickly as possible the number of merchants that accept RFID
     tokens; and to permit consumers freedom to choose multiple payment
     alternatives with a single token.
<BR><BR>[0009] Many of the Exxon Mobil gas stations are Speedpass enabled. In
     addition, a number of McDonalds restaurants in the Chicago area are now
     using Speedpass payments, and one grocery store chain began piloting
     Speedpass in late 2002. However, even with all this new development, RFID
     payments are still rare.
<BR><BR>[0010] Other drawbacks may also be present.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0011] Accordingly, one aspect of the invention is to address one or more
     of the drawbacks set forth above.
<BR><BR>[0012] Automobiles (or active communications devices) could be certified
     as trustworthy in applying and enforcing policies and procedures that
     will provide an environment for secure payments and other transactions.
     Current automobile design, including the use of electronic engine
     controllers (each of which have their own unique electronic identity)
     could be adjusted to include such functionality, and permit each
     particular car to include with each payment assurance proferred to
     counterparties its cryptographic certification electronically. The
     certification, could be standardized so the counterparties could clearly
     understand the level of trust applicable to a particular car. The car
     could also act as a conduit, trusted because of its certification to pass
     the credentials of the RFID device through to counter parties.
<BR><BR>[0013] According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a system for
     performing at least one payment transaction includes a token having a
     unique identifier associated with a user or key of a particular
     automobile, where the automobile is held out as an entity trusted by
     merchants and the token interacts with a reader in the automobile to

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0021] A system and process for using a token for performing purchase
     transactions is described. The system and process makes use of existing
     tokens distributed for other purposes or for purposes of payment, as well
     as newly distributed tokens, such as radio frequency identification
     devices, to perform purchase transactions. One technical effect of the
     invention is to provide a system and process for performing purchase
     transactions using, among other items, a radio frequency identification
     device, as set forth in the Brief Description of the Invention, above and
     as more fully described here in the Detailed Description of the
     Invention. Various aspects and components of this system and process are
     described below. While the present invention is described in terms of
     tokens, and radio frequency identification devices in particular, it is
     recognized that other types of tokens may also be used.
<BR><BR>[0022] The invention relates to a method and process by which an existing
     and large network of devices, as well as newly distributed devices, can
     be used by consumers to authenticate themselves, and permits each
     consumer to apply any of the various payments mechanisms available to
     him. The existing broadly distributed network is active and passive radio
     frequency identification ("RFID") devices held by consumers.
<BR><BR>[0023] FIG. 1 illustrates a system for performing purchase transactions
     with a token according to an embodiment of the invention. System 100
     includes a network 102, such as the internet, or other type of network.
     Reader 104 reads token 106. In the example illustrated in FIG. 1, token
     104 is an RFID device and reader 106 is equipped to read the RFID.
     However, it is recognized that other tokens may also be used. Further,
     while only one of each item is described for the convenience of
     explanation, it is understood that multiple devices may be used within
     the system 100.
<BR><BR>[0024] System 100 also includes a central controller 108 and a token
     account storage device 110. Central controller 108 connects with network
     102 and interfaces between network 102 and token account storage device
     110. Token account storage device 110, which may include one or more
     devices, stores information about the accounts associated with token 106.
     Each token 106 has a unique identifier associated with the token.
     Further, one or more accounts are associated with the token 106. Accounts
     may include a specific account associated solely with the token 106. This
     account may store funds, such as a stored value card, or may have a line
     of credit that is paid off periodically, such as a credit card. Further,
     other accounts may also be associated with the token 106, such as debit
     accounts, credit card accounts, and other types of financial accounts.
     Token account storage device 110 may communicate with funding sources 120
     to perform the purchase transaction. According to an embodiment of the
     invention, payment may be made directly by a transfer of funds from the
     user of the token to the merchant operating the reader, such as by a
     transfer of funds from a financial account of the user to the financial
     account of the merchant. Thus, a direct payment may be made with
     relatively little time delay.
<BR><BR>[0025] According to an embodiment of the invention, indirect payments may
     be made, with an entity trusted by a merchant serving to act as an
     intermediary guaranteeing payment. Payments are not made immediately, but
     the intermediary guarantees the merchant will be paid, thereby
     facilitating the performance of the purchase transaction. By way of
     example, an automobile manufacturer may provide a service (e.g., On Star
     provided by General Motors) to purchasers of the automobile that provides
     road-side assistance, navigation assistance, and the like. The service
     may also provide a guarantee of payment to a merchant on behalf of the
     automobile owner. The merchant than may move forward with the purchase
     transaction, while the actual payment is made at a later time.
<BR><BR>[0026] According to an embodiment of the invention, funding sources 120
     may include any source of funds, such as a bank, lender, company, or any
     other source of funding, such as institutions associated with financial
     accounts. Further, stored value device 122 may contain funds for
     performing purchase transactions. For example, funds from a financial
     account may be transferred into stored value device 122 and then accessed
     to perform a purchase transaction. According to an embodiment of the
     invention, funds from stored value device 122 may be used to perform
     certain types of purchase transactions (e.g., certain merchants,
     transactions below a certain monetary threshold, etc.). General entity
     124 is accessed by token account storage 110 to enable other transactions
     to be performed, such as accessing medical records, and transferring
     information.
<BR><BR>[0027] An example of passive RFID technology is the anti-theft technology
     used by auto companies. Historically, car keys depended on simple
     mechanical locking systems. Cars have increased in value, and now these
     simple mechanical systems provide inadequate security. Today, most cars
     use both a mechanical locking system and an RFID authentication system.
     In addition to the standard mechanical lock, car companies have provided
     a much more rigorous electronic protection mechanism. Keys contain RFID
     chips, and built into the ignition switch is an RFID reader. Even if the
     mechanical key is replicated, unless the RFID reader validates the key,
     the car will not start. The engine controller, an electronic chip buried
     deep within the engine itself, must recognize the RFID device or the
     engine will not start.
<BR><BR>[0028] Many passive RFID tokens for the automotive industry use automotive
     anti-theft `cryptographic challenge/response protocol.` This protocol
     used by auto companies does not rely on a singular ID number hardwired
     into every RFID device. However, that singular identity number is always
     accessible using a standards based (QS2000) protocol. It is that identity
     number that is used for all Speedpass and 2Scoot devices. The RFID
     identity number is unique and can be used to access any payments system
     available to the owner of the token. An RFID device may use a standard
     protocol to provide a transport mechanism for information, such as the
     frequency of the RFID device, etc. According to an embodiment of the
     invention, <B><I>security protocol</I></B> may also be proprietary to a receiver.
     However, non secret information may be available to all, such as that
     every RFID device has unique number and that the unique number is
     necessary for access.
<BR><BR>[0029] Authentication list 118 determines if reader 104 and/or token 106
     is authentic and permitted to perform transactions. Authentication list
     may be used as security to reduce the chances of fraud. According to an
     embodiment of the invention, token 106 may include information about the
     address (e.g., internet address) of central controller 108. Reader 104
     may then access central controller 108 to perform the purchase
     transaction. Authentication list 118 may be accessed to ensure that token
     106 is allowed to perform a transaction. For example, authentication list
     118 may contain a list of tokens 106 that are in good standing, or that
     are delinquent. While FIG. 1 illustrates authentication list 118 in
     communication with central controller 108, it is understood that
     authentication list 118 may be in communication with or resident on
     reader 104 and/or register/reader 112. Authentication list 118 may also
     ensure that reader 104 is allowed to access central controller 108.
     According to an embodiment of the invention, authentication list 118 may
     also include a list of authorized readers and register/readers that are
     permitted to access central controller 108.
<BR><BR>[0030] System 100 of FIG. 1 also includes a register/reader 112. It is
     understood that while the reader 104, and the register/reader 112 are
     included in system 100, other types of readers and devices for token 106
     to interact with network 102 may also be used. Further, various
     functionalities may be provided by register/reader 112 as necessary to
     implement one or more aspects of the present invention. Register/reader
     112, described in greater detail in FIG. 2 below, enables a user to
     register a token, register a financial account to be associated with the
     token, provide terms for purchase transactions and other information.
<BR><BR>[0031] FIG. 2 illustrates token 106 in communication with reader/register
     112. According to an embodiment of the invention, reader/register
     includes a receiver 220, processor 222, display 224, input 226, printer
     228, storage 230, bioinformatics reader 232 and input/output 234.
     According to the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, token 106 is an RFID
     device. Transceiver 220 receives signals from token 106 and transmits
     signals to token 106. The signals are converted and sent to processor 222
     for appropriate processing. Information from the processing may be
     displayed at display 224. Display 224 may include a RGB monitor or other
     manner of displaying information. For example, display 224 may display
     the amount of the purchase transaction, and, where token 106 with a
     plurality of accounts associated to it, a selection of which account to
     perform the purchase transaction. Other functionalities, such as a
     security and encryption, customer loyalty programs, and approval lists,
     may also be available in register/reader 112.
<BR><BR>[0032] Input 226 enables a user to interact with register/reader 112.
     Input 226 may include a keyboard, touch-screen, mouse, number pad or
     other manner of inputting information. For example, where token 106 has a
     plurality of accounts associated with it, display 224 may display options
     for the financial accounts to perform the purchase transaction. The user
     can select the appropriate financial account using input 226. At the
     conclusion of the purchase transaction, a receipt may be printed by
     printer 228.
<BR><BR>[0033] Information from the purchase transaction is stored in storage 230.
     Information may then be transmitted through input/output module 234 to
     the network. For example, information may be stored in storage 230 for a
     set period of time, and then communicated to purchase transaction account
     storage 116 (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
<BR><BR>[0034] In addition, bio-metrics module 232 provides bio-metric information
     about the user of the token 106. Bio-metric module 232 may be a retina
     scan, a finger print reader or other manner of providing bio-metric
     information. According to an embodiment of the invention, for some
     information and transactions, it may be desirable for the user of token
     106 to confirm his or her identity. This may be confirmed by providing
     bio-metric information, by entering a personal identification number
     ("PIN") through input 226, or through other manners of confirmation.
<BR><BR>[0035] For example, at a bank, office or store, a register/reader station
     for RFID tokens may have side-by-side a normal magnetic-stripe reader and
     a RFID reader. The process by which a credit card holder could register
     his personal car key may involve swiping the credit card, touching the
     RFID token, for example the car key, and presenting the credit card and
     signature, for validation by an attendant.
<BR><BR>[0036] Invisible to the customer would be a pre-authorization check of the
     credit card, and registration of the card with the token's unique
     identification number. The registration will cause the particular credit
     card to become the default payment mechanism for the token. In addition
     to the signature check, other information could be captured at
     registration, e.g., social security number, mother's maiden name,
     address, car license plate number, etc. The goal of registering the token
     may be to obtain VISA, MasterCard, American Express, or other credit card
     approval that the token is as secure as a card present transaction and
     thus entitled to the same interchange. Additionally, registering the
     token may occur in a closed loop environment, where an outside financial
     network, such as credit card network, is not involved.
<BR><BR>[0037] Central controller 114 of FIG. 1 also provides an interface between
     network 102 and account storage 116. Information from reader 104 and/or
     register/reader 112 is transmitted to central controller 114 to be stored
     in account storage 116. Information to be stored may include details
     regarding the purchase transaction, as well as other statistics. For
     example, purchase transaction information may be stored in account
     storage 116 for a set period of time, and then communicated to token
     account storage 110 to finalize the purchase transaction (e.g., daily,
     weekly, monthly, etc.). Alternatively, account storage 116 may
     communicate directly with funding sources 120 to finalize the purchase
     transaction.
<BR><BR>[0038] The invention encompasses a means by which a consumer can register
     his RFID car key, to permit him to authenticate himself to a payments
     network and to execute payment transactions. Registration might be as
     simple as swiping his credit card, and immediately subsequently having
     his car key's RFID number read. At the same time, the owner of the car
     key can be asked for pertinent personal information. Some credit card
     companies may be more comfortable if the consumer executes a signature at
     the same time. A further means of assuring the correct user is registered
     would be to mail a temporary PIN to the credit cardholder's home address.
     Another means to verify the registration might be to validate with the
     department of motor vehicles that the registrant is in fact an owner of
     the specified vehicle. With one card registered to the RFID car key, it
     should be easy asynchronously to register his other bank/credit cards, so
     long as the mailing address is the same.
<BR><BR>[0039] FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a process for performing token
     and account registration according to an embodiment of the invention. At
     step 305, an RFID device is activated. Although the example illustrated
     in FIG. 3 used an RFID device as the token, it is understood that other
     types of tokens may also be used. Activation of an RFID device may
     include transmitting a signal to a passive RFID device, communicating
     with a server, or activating the appropriate power source in an active
     RFID device. According to an embodiment of the invention, activation of
     the token, such as an RFID device, occurs when the server recognizes the
     RFID device, thereby enabling purchase transactions and other
     transactions to be performed. While the process illustrated in FIG. 3
     discloses certain steps performed in a particular order, it should be
     understood that the present invention may be practiced by adding one or
     more steps to the process, omitting steps within the process, and/or
     altering the order in which one or more steps are performed.
<BR><BR>[0040] At step 310, the unique identification identifier is read, and an
     account is created for the RFID device at step 315. The terms of the
     account are established at step 320, and the account information is
     stored at step 325. Terms may include permissions to use the account, the
     amount of the purchase transaction authorization for the account, the
     priority of the account if more than one financial account is associated
     with the RFID device, or other terms for performing the purchase
     transaction. By way of illustrative example, terms for a particular
     account may include authorizing purchase transactions under a particular
     amount without requiring a validation or confirmation. By way of another
     illustrative example, certain accounts may not be valid at certain times
     of the day, or for certain merchants. By way of a further illustrative
     example, one account may be set as a default, such that unless otherwise
     selected by the user of the RFID device, the default financial account
     will be used to perform the purchase transaction. Other terms may also be
     used. By way of another example, certain transactions may be performed
     using a specific financial account (e.g., under $50) or those made at
     specific merchants or types of merchants (e.g., purchases at gas
     stations).
<BR><BR>[0041] A financial account is registered at step 330. Financial accounts
     may include credit card accounts, bank accounts, debit accounts, or other
     type of monetary accounts direct or indirect. The financial account is
     associated with the RFID device and the unique identifier at step 335. By
     associating a financial account with the RFID device and the unique
     identifier, the financial account may be used to perform a purchase
     transaction.
<BR><BR>[0042] At step 340, the terms of the financial account are established.
     The terms for the financial account may be the same as those set forth
     above. At step 345, the information for the financial account is stored.
     At step 350, a determination is made whether additional financial
     accounts are to be registered with the RFID device. If yes, the process
     returns to step 330 to register the financial account. If not, the
     process ends at step 355.
<BR><BR>[0043] FIG. 4 is a flow chart illustrating a process for performing token
     and account registration according to an embodiment of the invention. At
     step 405, an RFID device is activated. Although the example illustrated
     in FIG. 4 used an RFID device as the token, it is understood that other
     types of tokens may also be used. Activation of an RFID device may
     include transmitting a signal to a passive RFID device, activating at a
     server or activating the appropriate power source in an active RFID
     device. While the process illustrated in FIG. 4 discloses certain steps
     performed in a particular order, it should be understood that the present
     invention may be practiced by adding one or more steps to the process,
     omitting steps within the process, and/or altering the order in which one
     or more steps are performed.
<BR><BR>[0044] At step 410, the unique identification identifier is read. At step
     415, the network protocol used for the particular purchase transaction is
     determined. According to an embodiment of the invention, different
     readers may operate on the same frequency, but use different protocols. A
     token, such as an RFID device, may be programmed in a specific protocol,
     and the reader may be programmed to determine what protocol is being used
     and process the information accordingly.
<BR><BR>[0045] The purchase amount is generated at step 420. At step 425, the
     purchase transaction is authorized. Authentication may include inputting
     a PIN, providing bio-metric information, inputting a password, or other
     manner of authentication. Once authenticated, authorization may include
     confirming that a purchase transaction has been approved. According to an
     embodiment of the invention, authorization may be completed when the
     token is authorized at the server, such as central controller 108. As
     described previously in reference to FIG. 1, authentication list 118
     determines if reader 104 and/or token 106 is authentic and permitted to
     perform transactions. Authentication list may be used as security to
     reduce the chances of fraud. According to an embodiment of the invention,
     token 106 may include information about the address (e.g., internet
     address) of central controller 108. Reader 104 may then access central
     controller 108 to perform the purchase transaction. Authentication list
     118 may be accessed to ensure that token 106 is allowed to perform a
     transaction. For example, authentication list 118 may contain a list of
     tokens 106 that are in good standing, or that are delinquent. While FIG.
     1 illustrates authentication list 118 in communication with central
     controller 108, it is understood that authentication list 118 may be in
     communication with or resident on reader 104 and/or register/reader 112.
     Authentication list 118 may also ensure that reader 104 is allowed to
     access central controller 108. According to an embodiment of the
     invention, authentication list 118 may also include a list of authorized
     readers and register/readers that are permitted to access central
     controller 108.
<BR><BR>[0046] At step 430, a determination is made whether more than one
     financial account is associated with the RFID device. If only one
     financial account is associated with the RFID device, the account is
     charged for the purchase transaction at step 435. The account may be
     charged using any conventional process, such as that used for credit card
     and debit card transactions. Other manners for charging an account may
     also be used.
<BR><BR>[0047] At step 450, the purchase transaction is then finalized. Finalizing
     the purchase transaction may include printing a receipt, confirming that
     the transaction has been made, or other steps used to conventionally
     finalize a purchase.
<BR><BR>[0048] If there is more that one financial account associated with the
     RFID device, an account is selected at step 440 and the selected account
     is charged for the purchase transaction at step 445. Selecting an account
     may involve the user of the RFID device selecting the particular account,
     or, if no selection has been made, selecting the account designated as
     the default account. The account may be charged using any conventional
     process, such as that used for credit card and debit card transactions.
     Other manners for charging an account may also be used.
<BR><BR>[0049] In the process of seeking authorization for a particular
     transaction, the account specified to be debited may not have adequate
     resources to cover the transaction. In that event, whether the account
     was funded on a pre-pay or post-pay basis, the Central Controller 108,
     could: (i) by prior arrangement, automatically top-up the account with
     additional resources by seeking additional credit/funds from a specified
     account; (ii) seek funds from any other default funding/credit accounts;
     or (iii) reject the transaction. Other processes may also be used.
<BR><BR>[0050] Again, at step 450, the purchase transaction is then finalized.
     Finalizing the purchase transaction may include printing a receipt,
     confirming that the transaction has been made, or other steps used to
     conventionally finalize a purchase. The process then ends at step 455.
<BR><BR>[0051] In addition to using the RFID car key or other token for making
     payments, the same authentication mechanism is useful generally to
     validate one's identity. For example, the RFID car key can be used to
     authenticate oneself to a virtual private network ("VPN"), or other
     secure networks, for physical access to premises, for buying and selling
     securities or other non-payment transactions, for purposes of timecards,
     for loyalty programs, or to one's medical insurer. The token can be used
     both with and without PIN, bio-metric, passwords or other identification
     confirmations. For lower value transactions, a consumer might choose the
     convenience of not requiring a PIN. For larger transactions, a consumer
     may choose to require the use of a PIN or bio-metric information.
<BR><BR>[0052] Using a single device for multiple purposes will be much more
     convenient for consumers, who can begin to skinny down their wallets. If
     the token is lost, it is also easier for the consumer to revoke all his
     powers at once. The consumer can simply revoke the token's authorities
     and instantaneously all the powers of the token will be lost. As relevant
     information is already available, re-registering is eased as the new
     token need only be associated with the financial accounts.
<BR><BR>[0053] Currently, most RFID devices operate at around 134 kHz. However, a
     new generation of RFID devices may operate at other frequencies, such as
     13 MHz. Higher frequency devices may be less expensive to build and will
     permit higher bandwidth (i.e. quicker) communications. About 70% of the
     40 million cars produced in 2001 were equipped with RFID anti-theft
     systems. The cars have an RFID reader in the ignition switch. Unless the
     electronic engine controller recognizes the car key's RFID token, the car
     will not start.According to an embodiment of the invention, various
     aspects of the RFID car keys make them useful as payment devices. First,
     each key has a unique ID number. Such car keys protect the owner's unique
     number much more securely than a magnetic stripe card. Second, there is a
     single, standard protocol that permits RFID readers to access the unique
     number on all RFID chips. Thus, standard RFID readers permit ordinary car
     keys to become trusted hardware authentication tokens. After a simple
     registration process, consumers may use their car keys to make payments
     at any store with an ordinary RFID reader.
<BR><BR>[0054] According to an embodiment of the invention, a primary registration
     may require the physical presence of the token. Additional credit cards
     and other financial accounts with the same name and billing address could
     be added to the token at a registration station merely by swiping the new
     credit card and touching the token, one-after-the-other. Subsequent cards
     could also be added online, or by using a VRU (though security may
     require some additional identification information).
<BR><BR>[0055] Token owners can choose to use any of their available payment
     mechanisms at any merchant, and the owner's payment choices can be
     changed easily. The owner will make payment elections online or over a
     VRU and will be able to specify the mode of authentication required for
     different types of transactions, e.g. require a PIN for online or larger
     payments.
<BR><BR>[0056] A token, such as an RFID device, will be accepted at any merchant
     that takes any RFID payments. In the simplest case, a consumer will
     simply bring the token close to the reader at checkout. The reader will
     automatically debit the payment account specified by the consumer.
     Consumers may specify more than one payment mechanism for a merchant. In
     that case, a merchant's payment wizard will select the payment mechanism
     with the lowest merchant discount. If the consumer has not specified a
     particular payment mechanism for a merchant, the default payment method
     will be charged.
<BR><BR>[0057] Online purchases are also possible when a computer is equipped with
     an RFID reader. The incremental cost of adding that functionality to a
     personal computer ("PC") may be minimal. With a widely deployed base of
     tokens, RFID enabled PCs can offer very substantial benefits in addition
     to secure payments. PCs equipped with RFID readers could be used to
     secure data on the PC, to access secure networks, for VPNs, for remote
     access, etc.
<BR><BR>[0058] According to an embodiment of the invention, consumers may be able
     selectively to impose additional security protections. A PIN may be
     required for purchases at specific stores, or for amounts larger than a
     specified ceiling. Consumers may also choose to impose a daily or weekly
     maximum aggregate spending limit. Subordinate tokens may be restricted to
     purchases from specific stores, or for age appropriate materials
     (especially useful for online purchases).
<BR><BR>[0059] By way of an example of an embodiment of the invention, a car might
     be sold with one master token, registered as the property of the owner of
     the car. Using the master token, the owner of a car might create,
     authorize or reject driving priviledges, payment capabilities, etc., for
     other users of tokens to his car. The master token holder might act as
     the registration agent for subordinate tokens, and could also be
     empowered to revoke or suspend the powers for subordinate tokens. An
     additional validation check before registering a master token might be to
     compare the credit card billing address with the address of the
     registered owner of the vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0060] Similarly, a token might be registered to the owner of a house
     fitted with an electronic RFID lock. The house master token could be used
     to register other authorized users of the house. Such registration might
     be very simple, e.g., touch the house master token, insert a PIN and then
     touch the subordinate token. Subordinate tokens might have time-limited
     efficacy, e.g., a teenager's token might not work after his curfew.
<BR><BR>[0061] One aspect of the RFID functionality is their use for
     personalization, as well as for heavier payments and authorizations.
     Readers are not bound by the same constraints as the passive RFID devices
     (size, cost, etc.). Typical RFID readers will have some source of power
     and be connected to some device, network, or system that takes advantage
     of the RFID validation, e.g., POS, EPoS, ECR, fire wall, engine
     controller, physical lock to premises, etc.. The RFID reader may be
     equipped with an antenna tuned to listen for faint signals at a specific
     frequency, e.g., 134 kHz. More complex RF communications could simply be
     enabled with software. The two-way, secure communication could use RF
     (with the same frequency as the passive RFID device or a different one),
     or other protocols such as Bluetooth or 802.11.
<BR><BR>[0062] One manner for expanding the functionality of the passive RFID
     device is to link its powers to an active device. Such devices might
     include a wire line or cellular phone, computer, Blackberry, PDA or other
     similar device (hereinafter also referred to as "Active Communications
     Device"). Such Active Communications Devices typically have power, or
     access to power, one or more communications channels, a CPU that is much
     more powerful than the passive RFID, memory that can be dynamically
     accessed, data entry capability and a visual display. The passive RFID
     token that is validated might be electrically connected to the Active
     Communications Device; physically attached, but not electrically
     connected, e.g. RFID chip embedded in the faceplate of a cell phone; or,
     separate from the Active Communications Device. For example, when an
     Active Communications Device is a mobile telephone, an RFID device may be
     located in face plate of the telephone. The RIFD device may be a passive
     device, and the mobile telephone may have an RFID reader. The mobile
     telephone then communicates the necessary information. Alternatively, the
     RFID device may be physically connected to the mobile telephone, such as
     by electrical leads. The link between the RFID and the Active
     Communications Device may be established at the manufacturer, or later,
     by direct or indirect contact with registration authority, or over a
     network. Other embodiments may also be used.
<BR><BR>[0063] Once an authenticated passive RFID is recognized and accepted by an
     RFID reader, the holder of the RFID device could take advantage of that
     trusted authentication, to engage an active device capable of more
     complex, secure communications. The key step to achieve this result will
     be to transfer the passive RFID's trusted validation, to a more capable
     communications device. There are many different ways for that trust to be
     transferred, three different examples are disclosed here.
<BR><BR>[0064] While two examples for linking, by prior arrangement, an
     authenticated passive RFID device to an Active Communications Device are
     disclosed below, it is understood that other examples are also within the
     scope of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0065] Just as a passive RFID device can be registered to enable multiple
     payments modes (e.g., credit cards, debit and stored value accounts,
     etc.), and other non-payment authorizations; RFID devices can be securely
     linked to other devices, including Active Communications Devices. By
     registering a passive RFID device with an Active Communications Device's
     unique identifier, that Active Communications Device can inherit all the
     authentication and authorization capabilities of the passive RFID device.
     Thereafter, the holder of a passive RFID device could use it wherever it
     is convenient (e.g., where a merchant's POS is capable only of
     recognizing a passive RFID device) and would also use the same set of
     capabilities using his Active Communications Device to take advantage of
     less limited reader capabilities where available.
<BR><BR>[0066] In the case of automotive security, during secure instantiation of
     each token, the engine controller communicates its secret to the token.
     The engine controller will start the car only for `friendly` tokens that
     know its secret. For example, controller A (the engine controller) shares
     its secret with token B (the token). Because controller A controls
     distribution of its secret, controller A will trust all token Bs that
     know its secret.
<BR><BR>[0067] To establish a link between a passive RFID device and an Active
     Communications Device that can be trusted by RFID readers may be somewhat
     more complex. The Active Communications Device may securely share its
     secret with the passive RFID device in a manner similar to the way engine
     controllers instantiate tokens and in a carefully controlled
     circumstance. The passive RFID device subsequently may communicate to a
     reader both the RFID device's unique identifier number and the secret
     shared with the Active Communications Device. The RFID reader may then
     trust communications with the Active Communications Device that
     identified itself with the same RFID secret. Alternatively, the Active
     Communications Device could be certified by a payment authority entrusted
     to pass RFID information for payment authorization.
<BR><BR>[0068] The RFID reader validates and then trusts the authenticated passive
     RFID device. The authenticated passive RFID device separately
     communicates to the RFID reader a secret. The RFID reader then can trust
     the Active Communications Device and knows that the authenticated passive
     RFID device's secret. Based on the security model, the trust can be time
     limited (e.g. where the RFID reader will recognize the Active
     Communications Device only when the authenticated passive RFID device and
     C are used contemporaneously), or not. In addition, the reverse mechanism
     can also work, where the authenticated Active Communications Device is
     linked to a passive RFID device. In a manner similar to the engine
     controller, an Active Communications Device might share its secret with
     the passive RFID device.
<BR><BR>[0069] Linkage of a passive RFID device to an Active Communications Device
     by prior arrangement may be useful when that linkage is intended to be
     persistent. There are circumstances where such persistence is not
     desirable. For example, suppose in the future a driver rents a car and
     wishes to use his passive RFID token to pay tolls. Rental cars are used
     by many different people, persistent linkage of RFID devices personal to
     drivers present problems for such temporary connections. One means to
     provide for payment of tolls would be to take advantage of the driver's
     payment capability, by simply using a car's transmitter to broadcast that
     capability to the toll collectors. The system would work so long as the
     car validates the drivers ability to pay and is trusted as a payment
     agent or the transmitter can directly pass the driver's credentials.
<BR><BR>[0070] Small, relatively inexpensive toll tags permit cars to be
     recognized and charged for tolls while traveling as fast as 200 MPH. Toll
     tags are active RFID devices, with batteries and the ability to transmit
     signals. Across the country, there are a plethora of divergent toll tag
     protocols that are not interoperable. It would be cheap and easy to build
     a single, multi-purpose electronic device to permit cars to communicate
     with all the various toll tag readers. If the car could authenticate a
     driver's ability to pay, drivers might travel across the country without
     ever stopping to pay cash for tolls.
<BR><BR>[0071] Drivers could individually register with each different toll
     authority, or execute a single, multi-registration that covers many toll
     authorities. The toll registration could provide for a single stored
     value account, which would automatically be debited by each of the
     various toll authorities and topped-up using a single source of payment.
     The payment account could be linked to a single RFID device.
<BR><BR>[0072] For each car enabled with the universal toll transmitter, drivers
     could authenticate themselves with their personal RFID token, and proceed
     through the speedier toll tag lines, no muss no fuss. Since most new cars
     already have RFID readers, it would be quite easy to enable a second site
     convenient to permit drivers to authenticate their passive RFID devices.
<BR><BR>[0073] If a passive RFID device has a broadly accepted payment mechanism
     attached, sometimes prior registration with the toll authorities might be
     avoided. The toll collector could optimistically accept the RFID number,
     and seek payment. Photographing the license plate or some similar
     mechanism could provide anti-fraud protection.
<BR><BR>[0074] According to an embodiment of the invention, the systems and
     processes described in this invention may be implemented on any general
     or special purpose computational device, either as a standalone
     application or applications, or even across several general or special
     purpose computational devices connected over a network and as a group
     operating in a client-server mode. According to another embodiment of the
     invention, a computer-usable and writeable medium having a plurality of
     computer readable program code stored therein may be provided for
     practicing the process of the present invention. The process and system
     of the present invention may be implemented within a variety of operating
     systems, such as a Windows.RTM. operating system, various versions of a
     Unix-based operating system (e.g., a Hewlett Packard, a Red Hat, or a
     Linux version of a Unix-based operating system), or various versions of
     an AS/400-based operating system. For example, the computer-usable and
     writeable medium may be comprised of a CD ROM, a floppy disk, a hard
     disk, or any other computer-usable medium. One or more of the components
     of the system or systems embodying the present invention may comprise
     computer readable program code in the form of functional instructions
     stored in the computer-usable medium such that when the computer-usable
     medium is installed on the system or systems, those components cause the
     system to perform the functions described. The computer readable program
     code for the present invention may also be bundled with other computer
     readable program software. Also, only some of the components may be
     provided in computer-readable code.
<BR><BR>[0075] Additionally, various entities and combinations of entities may
     employ a computer to implement the components performing the
     above-described functions. According to an embodiment of the invention,
     the computer may be a standard computer comprising an input device, an
     output device, a processor device, and a data storage device. According
     to other embodiments of the invention, various components may be
     computers in different departments within the same corporation or entity.
     Other computer configurations may also be used. According to another
     embodiment of the invention, various components may be separate entities
     such as corporations or limited liability companies. Other embodiments,
     in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, may also be used.
<BR><BR>[0076] According to one specific embodiment of the present invention, the
     system may comprise components of a software system. The system may
     operate on a network and may be connected to other systems sharing a
     common database. Other hardware arrangements may also be provided.

     specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. The
     specification and examples should be considered exemplary only. The
     intended scope of the invention is only limited by the claims appended
     hereto.
<BR><BR>[0078] While the invention has been particularly shown and described
     within the framework of performing purchase transactions using a token
     from an automobile, it will be appreciated that variations and
     modifications can be effected by a person of ordinary skill in the art
     without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, one of
     ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various types of tokens may
     be used to perform purchase transactions and that other types of
     transactions may also be performed using a token. Furthermore, one of
     ordinary skill in the art will recognize that such processes and systems
     do not need to be restricted to the specific embodiments described
     herein.
