<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>An electronic identification, control, and security system comprises a
     unique identification code associated with each manufactured article, a
     password code, communication circuitry capable of transmitting the
     password code to the manufactured articles, and appliance disabling
     circuitry. The appliance disabling circuitry may be integrated with the
     manufactured articles and precludes operation of the manufactured articles
     upon receipt of the password code. The communication circuitry preferably
     includes <B><I>RFID</I></B> technology to transmit the password code to the article and
     receive the unique identification code from the article. Such system
     deters theft of the articles. A method for deterring theft of manufactured
     articles includes the steps of providing a unique identification code for
     each manufactured article, transmitting a password via radio frequency to
     each manufactured article, and disabling operation of each manufactured
     article in response to receipt of the password. A manufactured appliance
     comprises security and control logic circuitry, data storage memory, a
     unique identification code stored in the memory, and communication
     circuitry for receiving a transmitted password. The security and control
     logic disables operation of the manufactured appliance in response to
     receipt of the password.

<CENTER><B><I>Claims</B></I></CENTER> <HR> <BR><BR>What is claimed is:<BR><BR>1.  A method for deterring theft of manufactured articles, comprising the steps of:
<BR><BR>programming a unique electronic universal product protection code (UPPC) into each manufactured article;
<BR><BR>associating the UPPC with a password in an external computer system;
<BR><BR>transmitting the password via radio frequency to each manufactured article;
<BR><BR>disabling operation of each manufactured article in response to receipt of the password;
<BR><BR>receiving UPPC information from a user for a particular article;
<BR><BR>recalling from the external computer system the password associated with the UPPC information for the particular manufactured article;  and
<BR><BR>transmitting the password to the user to enable operation of the particular manufactured article.
<BR><BR>2.  A method for deterring theft of manufactured articles, comprising the steps of:
<BR><BR>programming a unique electronic universal product protection code (UPPC) into each manufactured article;
<BR><BR>electronically interrogating al least one manufactured article for the UPPC information programmed herein prior to transport of the manufactured article;
<BR><BR>storing the UPPC information in a computerized shipping system;
<BR><BR>generating a password in the computerized shipping system associated with the UPPC information;  and
<BR><BR>transmitting the password via radio frequency to each manufactured article;  and
<BR><BR>disabling operation of each manufactured article in response to receipt to the password prior to shipping the manufactured articles.
<BR><BR>3.  The method of claim 2, further comprising the steps of:
<BR><BR>electronically interrogating the at least one manufactured article for the UPPC information programmed therein upon receipt of the at least one manufactured article;
<BR><BR>comparing the UPPC information stored in the computerized shipping system with the UPPC information interrogated upon receipt to confirm receipt of the at least one manufactured article transported;

<BR><BR>This invention relates to a system and method to remotely communicate with appliances and other consumer electronics, and more particularly to a system and a method which allows remote communication, control, and security for consumer electronics
via radio frequency transmission and the electric power distribution network.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Continued advances in the field of consumer electronics and appliances have added a significant number of features to these devices which make their operation simpler, while at the same time increasing their overall functionality.  Most pieces of
consumer electronics and appliances manufactured today include some sort of computer control within the unit itself.  These computers control everything from automatically remembering leap year and adjusting the number of days in February, to the
on-screen menu display, picture in picture control, cook cycle time control, to name just a few.  While these microprocessors are controlling ever increasing functionality of the consumer electronic devices and appliances into which they are
incorporated, their capacity for further increases remains vast.  Even with these advanced features and computer control, modern manufacturing techniques have allowed the cost of these devices to decrease since their initial introduction onto the market. However, even with such decreases, the cost of these electronic devices and appliances still remains fairly expensive.
<BR><BR>A persistent problem with electronic appliances exists mainly due to their expense and ease of portability.  This problem is the ease with which electronic appliances are stolen from homes, warehouses, and during transit.  Because these devices
are so enjoyable to own, and yet are priced out of the reach of many citizens, a significant market for stolen electronic appliances exists.  Their ease of portability and lack of security features and identification, as well as the relativity high
probability that the recipient of the stolen merchandise will not be caught, or if so not prosecuted, only exacerbates this problem.  Currently, most consumer electronics devices only carry a written serial number on the device to identify it in the
event of a theft, however, since many individuals fail to record or register this serial number, attempts to recover merchandise once it has been stolen often prove futile.
<BR><BR>At the manufacturing level, companies are continually looking for new methods to keep track of their inventory in an effort to better manage the business and prevent loss through theft.  One relatively new technology which many companies are now
beginning to utilize is a system of product identification and tracking known as RFID (radio frequency identification).  This new technology is primarily used for inventory control and tracking within the factory area and warehouse, and is typically
associated with the packaging of the product (a RFID label or tag on the box), and not with the product itself.
<BR><BR>RFID systems use radio frequency to identify, locate, and track items through a system comprising primarily of three components.  The system operates under control of a host computer which contains all of the inventory database information
required for operation of this system.  A passive RFID tag is the second component of the system and is typically applied via a disposable label to product packaging in similar fashion to a bar code tracking label.  This disposable label contains an
antenna coil and a silicon chip, and requires no separate power source.  The silicon chip includes basic modulation circuitry and non-volatile memory to store product identification information.  This disposable label is energized by the third component
of the system, a RFID reader or interrogator, which transmits a RF signal to the disposable label.  As the radio frequency signal passes through the antenna coil, an AC voltage is generated thereacross.  This voltage is rectified to supply power to the
silicon chip which then transmits the information stored therein back to the reader.  This information transmission technique is commonly known as backscattering.
<BR><BR>Current RFID labels work in one of three frequency ranges.  Low frequency tags generally operate below 135 kHz and are commonly used for access control and industrial control.  While energy at this frequency readily moves through people and other
obstacles, data rates are relatively low compared to those of other technologies.  Another frequency band used for RFID labels centers around 2.45 GHz, and operates under the same regulatory guidelines as local area networks OpenAir and 802.11.  While
data rates are greatly increased over the low frequency systems, the ability to transmit this energy through obstacles is somewhat reduced.  A benefit of this higher frequency system is that the antennas may be much smaller, and can be etched or screen
printed instead of wound from wire.  The third frequency band commonly used for RFID labels is 13.56 MHz, a frequency that has been allocated in much of the industrialized world.  While data rates are higher and antennas are smaller than with other
frequencies, the read ranges are often shorter.  A benefit of using this frequency exists due to the world wide allocation of this frequency which means that products may be deployed around the world with little or no modification to the RHD label.
<BR><BR>The amount of information which is able to be carried by a RFID label is be quite large.  One commercial implementation of a RFID label is marketed by Texas Instruments under the name Tag-It.  These commercially available RFID labels provide 256
bytes of user programmable read/write memory partitioned into eight 32 byte blocks.  A ninth block contains revision and manufacturing information, while a tenth block contains a unique 32 byte ID code sequentially assigned during manufacturing which is
able to provide 4.3 billion unique label identities.  Other designs including more or fewer programmable bytes are also available.  The distance at which the readers may read the memory information from the RFID label depends on environmental conditions
and obstructions, and for the TI Tag-It label is roughly equivalent to distances achievable by state of the art hand held CCD bar code scanners.  However, whereas bar codes must be visible and relatively close to the reader in order to be read, the RFID
label may be hidden from view, and depending on the design, may be read from several feet away, perhaps even 100 yards away without human intervention.
<BR><BR>In addition to increasing the distances at which RFID labels may be utilized, the technology associated with RFID continues to increase the number of RFID labels which may be read simultaneously by a single reader.  Various systems exist for
simultaneous RFID tag communication.  One such method marketed by Texas Instruments is known as SID (Simultaneous Identification) and is currently able to read thirty tags per second.  The SID algorithm uses a binary tree search through the unique code
stored in the RFID label, using commands that can silence tags momentarily to allow the read of information from other tags.  Another system takes advantage of a pseudo random number generator within the RFID label to command the tags to stop
transmitting until a generated pseudo random number counts down.  In this way, the probability of two tags counting down to the same pseudo random number and beginning to retransmit simultaneously is sufficiently low to allow proper operation of the
system.
<BR><BR>While the RFID label system promises great advances in the field of product tracking and inventory control, its ability to prevent theft is somewhat limited.  Specifically, since the RFID labels are placed on product packaging, a thief would
merely need to remove this label from the packaging in order to defeat any further tracking of the product.  Alternatively, a thief would simply need to remove the product from the packaging to also defeat further product tracking.  A product so stolen
remains fully operational, and therefore, has a high black market value.
<BR><BR>While the removal of the RFID label from the product packaging could be overcome by installing this label within the product itself, limitations on the distance at which a product may be scanned, the time required to complete the scan, and the
reduced ability to scan information through obstacles greatly reduces the ability of these RFID) labels to provide theft deterrence.  Specifically, products could be removed from a warehouse by placing an appropriate shield between the product and the
readers to prevent detection of the theft at the first instance.  However, even if the readers were able to detect the actual theft of the products, since these products remain fully operational and since the ability to detect the RFID label over
distance and through obstacles in very difficult at the power levels of conventional RFID labels, the probability of recovering the stolen merchandise is very small once sold on the black market.  Theft during transit of these products is even less
problematic for the thief since there are no readers to defeat which would provide initial detection of the theft.  1995 estimates of theft within the freight industry alone is $10 billion dollars.  This equates to 2.5% of $400 billion dollar industry.
<BR><BR>One of the reasons for such a high volume of theft, as mentioned briefly above, is because the electronic devices are so enjoyable to own.  The continued advances with the consumer electronics have greatly simplified their use both in terms of
programmability and user interaction.  One user interaction feature with which most consumers have become quite accustomed is the ability to remotely control their TV, stereo, VCR, camcorder, etc. While several items of consumer electronics offer this
remote control feature in a line-of-sight fashion with a hand held remote controller, the desire to electrically remotely control other appliances in a non-line-of-sight fashion also exists.
<BR><BR>In order to fulfill this desire to allow remote control of home appliances, electronic equipment, lighting, etc. several systems have been developed which allow control communications over a home's, electrical wiring system.  However, since most
home appliances and electronic equipment do not include communications and control circuitry to allow reception of the electrical system communication control signals, many of the systems which have been developed utilize separate plug-in modules which
interface between an appliance's electrical cord and the home electrical outlet.  While there is currently still no universally accepted standard for this communication over a home's electrical wiring system, two protocols have emerged as the
forerunners, and serve as a basis for many of the systems currently designed.  The first such protocol is commercially known and marketed as the X-10 communications protocol.  The second communications protocol which appears to be in wide use at this
time is known as the consumer electronics bus protocol (CEBus).  However, as mentioned above, neither one of these two has gained universal acceptance in the design of remotely controllable systems for home consumer appliances, lighting, etc. Indeed,
several systems which claim to allow remote control of home appliances, lighting, etc., utilize their own communications protocol which does not adhere to either one of the two aforementioned communication protocol forerunners.
<BR><BR>Exemplary systems which claim to allow remote control of home appliances, lighting, etc., may be found with reference to the following documents: U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,567,557; 5,051,720; 5,334,975; 5,400,246; 5,471,190; 5,491,463; 5,554,968;
5,570,085; 5,621,662; and European Patent Application No. 89 121025.4 bearing Publication No. 0 369 382 A2.  The disclosure of each of these documents, particularly as they relate to communications protocols allowing remote communications over an
electrical distribution system, are hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>While each of the above-identified systems claim certain benefits for a remotely controllable system, none of the systems are able to distinguish individual appliances within a household, other than by their physical or programmed location within
the household.  Specifically, many of the above systems utilize separate control modules which are plugged into the house's electrical outlets, and may be themselves remotely controlled via communication received over the electrical wiring system. 
However, if one were to unplug a particular appliance from one of these modules and move it to a different physical location within the house, the remote control system has no way of knowing that this has taken place without manual user interaction. 
While this reprogramming may seem to be a minor problem in view of the infrequency with which most consumer electronics and appliances are actually moved within a household, in view of the fact that many people have trouble reprogramming their VCR clock,
it is a problem to be avoided nonetheless.
<BR><BR>The unacceptability of this problem may be best highlighted through an example.  Assuming without admitting, that a remotely controlled system were capable of disabling a device, such as a television, at a certain time, if a parent were to
disable a television set located in a child's room after 8:00 PM, a child would only have to unplug the television set from the current electrical receptacle and replug the television set into a different electrical receptacle in order to defeat the
system programming and allow continued television viewing after 8:00 PM.  While the parent could conceivably disable all of the electrical outlets to the child's room, such is undesirable as this would prevent the child from using a night light, clock
radio alarm, etc. in his room.  While this may appear to be a simplistic example, parents with kids who own video games may well disagree.
<BR><BR>Another problem which exists from the user stand point, as discussed above from the manufacturer and transportation stand point is the ease at which these electronic devices are stolen from the home.  In addition to the significant financial loss
which must be borne by the homeowner as a result of a theft of these electronic devices, a significant safety risk exists to the homeowner from the presence of the thief within the home.  While the presence of electronic devices may not be sole cause for
home break-ins and thefts, the ease with which these items may be transported and sold on the black market certainly provides an incentive for these thieves.
<BR><BR>A device which attempts to overcome this problem is described in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,021,779, issued to Bisak on Jun.  4, 1991 for a SECURITY DFVICE.  The system contemplated by this patent utilizes a receiver-dccoder which is adapted and arranged
to allow the appliance to operate in its normal mode when the receiver-decoder receives a predetermined code carried via the electrical wiring system within the home.  If this predetermined code is not received by the receiver-decoder, the appliance
enters a security mode of operation.  Various alternative security modes of operation are described in this patent including the use of an alarm within the device, to trigger a transmitter device to sound an external alarm, or to transmit a silent signal
to the police department upon being plugged in to allow the apprehension of the thieves.  The encoder-transmitter of this system is arranged to frequency or phase modulate a carrier signal with a binary digital code and transmit that signal over the
electrical wiring system to the electronic appliance plugged into the wall socket of the household.  Once a consumer has set a particular code and transmitted that code over the electrical system to the electronic appliance, that code is kept in memory
and used to compare subsequent receptions to determine of the appliance is still connected within that consumer's household.
<BR><BR>However, as with the above-described control systems, the system of the Bisak '779 patent does not allow for individual identification of electronic appliances coupled to the system.  Nor does this system allow any type of control of the
electronic devices coupled to the electrical system of house.  Further, this security device operates on its own communications protocol operating at 260 kHz and transmitting a unique binary digital code which is suited only to the security feature.  The
system of Bisak '779 also does not address the problem of theft at the manufactory or transportation levels.

<BR><BR>While the invention is susceptible of various modifications and alternative constructions, certain illustrative embodiments thereof have been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail.  It should be understood, however, that
there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, alternative constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by
the appended claims. <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>To gain an understanding of the value and benefits of the system of the instant invention, an overall system level understanding is provided with reference to FIG. 1 before the design details of any aspect of a particular embodiment of the
invention is discussed.  With the system of the instant invention, both inventory tracking and theft prevention may be accomplished.  At the manufacturing level 10 individual appliances are constructed with security circuitry which allows the device to
be disable and prevented from operating until such time as the appliance is re-enabled.  In an embodiment of the instant invention the security circuitry includes an RFID interface to allow RF transmission and tracking of the individual appliances
through the manufacturing and inventory process.  From the security aspect of the invention a manufacturer sets a password through the RFID interface to disable the appliance from further operation.  The RFID information also includes an unique appliance
identification number known as a Universal Product Protection Code which may then be utilized for tracking of the product through the manufacturing and inventory process.  Once the manufacturing process is complete and the appliance is ready to be
shipped, the manufacturer may then send the Universal Product Protection Code (UPPC) information and the associated password to a data commerce and warehouse system.  Since the appliance will remain in the disabled state until the password is transmitted
to the appliance to enable operation thereof, theft of the appliance is deterred.
<BR><BR>Once the transportation phase of the appliance life cycle is complete, the retail store 26 may then reenable the product for sale.  To reenable operation of the product, the retail store 26 reads the serial number and requests transmission of the
password from the data commerce and warehouse 40.  Once the retail store has transmitted the password to the appliance, the appliance will operate in a normal fashion.  As will be discussed more fully hereinbelow, the request for the password and
reenabling of the appliance may take place as part of the point of sale through an automated credit card system.  In this way the retail store will be assured that theft of the appliances while in the stores own inventory will be deterred.  If the
particular appliance is acquired by a business organization 17, that business organization can set a unique or corporate password to allow operation of the device while plugged in within the business organization.  Once the password is transmitted to the
appliance, it will continue to operate in a normal fashion until it is de-energized, typically by being unplugged.  Once power is restored to the appliance, the appliance will enter a security mode of operation whereby normal operation will be precluded
until transmission of the previously set password is transmitted to the appliance.  Once again, theft of the appliance while at the business organization 17 is deterred.  This password may be transmitted to the data commerce and warehouse 40 to provide a
central electronic warehouse of the required enabling passwords in so desired.  Additionally, because the system includes the TPPC which is unique for each appliance, a security service 19 may be notified upon detection of the unplugging of a device (the
details of which will be provided more fully below).
<BR><BR>If, on the other hand, the appliance is purchased from the retail store 26 by a consumer 30, it is the consumer who then may set a personal password for the appliance to allow its operation while plugged in to the consumer's dwelling.  As with
the business organization 17, the setting of the password by the consumer 30 will allow normal operation of the appliance until the appliance is de-energized, typically by unplugging the unit.  Once the electronic appliance is plugged in or otherwise
energized, it will enter the secure mode of operation precluding further operation until transmission of the personal password is complete.  As discussed above, the theft of this appliance is therefore deterred.  Also analogous to the business
organization 17, the consumer 30 may transmit the UPPC and password information to the data commerce and warehouse 40 to provide a central registry of this information for disaster recovery and product retrieval in the event of actual theft.  Likewise,
the system of the instant invention at the consumer's dwelling may be programmed to contact a security service 19 for various theft related conditions such as the detection of more than one appliance being unplugged in a short period of time.  The
preferred mechanism for setting such a password in the consumer environment 30 is a personal computer or a hand held encoder/decoder as will be discussed more fully below.
<BR><BR>While the system of FIG. 1 illustrates the use of a central data commerce and warehouse 40, one skilled in the art will recognize that such a centralized electronic data commerce and warehouse may not be desired.  Such a system is illustrated in
state diagrammatic form in FIG. 2 to which specific reference is now made.  The discussion of this alternative embodiment of the system of the instant invention will focus on the functional operation of the system, highlighting each step of the
manufacturing, transportation, distribution, and retail stage.  In accordance with the teachings of the instant invention, therefore, an appliance manufacturer 10 manufactures an appliance having some form of functional electronics incorporated therein. 
During the manufacturing process, the appliance manufacturer 10 individually secures the appliance, as will be described more fully hereinbelow, to preclude any internal theft 12 of the appliance.  Once the manufacturing process is complete, the
appliance is transported 14 through the mails, via a common carrier such as a trucking company, a shipping company, or a train.  Since the appliance is shipped from the appliance manufacturer 10 in a secured state, hijacking 16 of the appliance during
transportation is no longer viable since a highjacked appliance cannot be operated, and therefore has an extremely low black market fence value.  The secured appliance, therefore, will arrive at a distribution center 18 still in a secured state.  From
the distribution center 18, the appliance is then transported 20 to the various retail stores 26.  Also during this phase of transportation 20, the highjacking, 22 of the appliance is equally disadvantageous due to the secured state of the appliance. 
Having arrived safely, the appliance may be stored in a stock room 24 until it is sold at the retail store 26.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment of the instant invention, the retail store 26, upon successfully negotiating a purchase 28 with a consumer 30, requests security information 32 from the appliance manufacturer 10.  In response, the appliance manufacturer 10
sends security information 34 to the retail store 26 to allow the appliance to be placed in an unsecured state at the time of purchase 28.  Alternatively, the security information may be provided to the consumer either directly from the manufacturer 10
or through the retail store 26.  In one embodiment, the appliance is provided with a fixed password which is provided to the consumer 30 to allow operation of the appliance.
<BR><BR>Upon returning home with the purchased appliance, the consumer 30 may then secure the appliance as will be described more fully hereinbelow.  Additionally, the consumer 30 may also register 36 the appliance with the appliance manufacturer,
receiving a registration acknowledgment in response, to allow warranty claims and replacement 38 of appliance components in the future.  These warranty claims and replacements 38 are indicated in FIG. 2 as being an unauthorized state which may actually
be either (1) unsecured, or (2) set with a manufacturer password or a password which is communicated to the manufacturer to allow operational testing and repair of the appliance.
<BR><BR>In the hands of the consumer 30, the appliance is in a user definable state.  The user, in accordance with the teachings of the instant invention, may choose to secure the appliance from future theft, or may choose to leave the appliance in an
unsecured state by simply failing to set the security feature within the unsecured appliance.  The method for setting the security feature within the appliance, as well as the system used to provide this security, will be described more fully
hereinbelow.
<BR><BR>In an alternate embodiment of the instant invention which is more closely linked to that of FIG. 1, as illustrated in FIG. 3, a central or distributed registration authority 40 is included within the system to provide central security and
database tracking of security information for manufactured appliances to aid in the security, authentication, and theft recovery of consumer appliances.  In this embodiment of the instant invention, the appliance manufacturer first sends security
information for each of the appliances manufactured and secured therein to the registration authority.  The registration authority 40 stores this security information for each manufactured appliance for later coordination and retrieval, and sends a
security acknowledgment 44 to the appliance manufacturer 10.  This indicates that the registration authority has successfully registered the secured appliance.
<BR><BR>With this central authority 40, the retail store 26 no longer needs to communicate directly with the appliance manufacturer 10, but instead may request security information 46 directly from the registration authority 40 upon the negotiation of a
purchase 28 with a consumer 30 of the secured appliance.  In response, the registration authority 40 transmits 48 the security acknowledgment to the retail store 26 so that the appliance may be placed in the unsecured state, allowing the consumer 30 to
later operate the appliance.  Once in the hands of the consumer 30 the appliance is now in a user definable state wherein the user may, as described above, either choose to secure the appliance, or leave it in an unsecured state.  Should the consumer
decide to place the appliance in a secured state, he may do so without further required interaction with any other party.  Alternatively, he may secure the device through a consumer registration communication 50 with the registration authority similarly
as described above.  Once the consumer registration information has been stored by the registration authority 40, a security acknowledgment 50, which may be a password, is transmitted to the consumer 30 via voice or modem communication.  This password
may then be utilized in one embodiment of the instant invention to unlock the consumer's ability to set his or her own password via the voice or modem communication.  Security for this information transfer may be provided through any available means of
<B><I>encryption</I></B> as appropriate.
<BR><BR>In addition to the security and UPPC information which may be transmitted to and from the registration authority 40, once the appliance has been purchased from the retail store 26 consumer registration and warranty information received from the
consumer 30 may be transmitted via the registration authority 40 to the appliance manufacturer 10.  The registration authority 40 may also transmit manufacturing specifications, diagnostics, help, and other user manuals directly to the consumer 30 if so
desired.  The registration authority 40 also provides a mechanism for automatic notification of recall information or other safety issues which must be transmitted to the consumers 30 who have purchased the particular products for which this information
is needed.
<BR><BR>With this overall system level understanding of the invention in hand, a more detailed locus at each phase of the manufacturing, distribution, and retail sale of the appliance is now appropriate.  Beginning with the manufacturing phase, and with
reference now to FIG. 4, a manufacturer 10 encodes each individual appliance with a unique Universal Product Protection Code (UPPC) and a security password via a radio frequency transmission of this information.  Preferably, an RFID reader or
interrogator 21 is utilized in the manufacturing process to transmit this information directly to the individual appliances.  This information is generated and stored by the manufacturer's business system 23 which typically has been used to track
inventory and other information relating to the manufacturing process.  In a preferred embodiment, each individual appliance is manufactured with a unique UPPC which is first read by the RFID interrogator 21 and transmitted to the business system 23. 
The business system 23 then preferable transmits to the interrogator 21 the security password information to be encoded into the individual appliance.  The UPPC/password information is correlated and stored within the business system.  This information
may be transmitted from business system 23 to the registration authority 40 at any point during the manufacturing process, and is preferably transmitted as part of an online shipping system 25 used in association with the transportation provider.
<BR><BR>When the system of the instant invention is utilized with an online shippingsystem 25, the shipping carrier 27 may verify the contents of the cargo through the use of an RFID interrogator 31.  This interrogator 31 may utilize simultaneous
communication techniques with the RFID system to allow verification of cargo contents without requiring individual scanning of the individual products on a shipping pallet.  The information received through the RFID interface may be entered into the
online system 25 via an encoder interface 33 which utilizes either an RF or docking station type interface with the interrogator 31.  Once the information concerning the specific identity of each of the appliances being shipped is entered into the online
shipping system 25 this information may be transmitted to the registration authority 40.  Because the appliances have all been disabled at the manufacturing level 10 via the transmission of the password, theft in transit due to hijacking is greatly
deterred.  Alternatively, the shipping carrier may set its own password to maintain control over the shipment.
<BR><BR>Once the cargo 35 arrives from the shipping carrier 27 at the warehouse, verification of the specific contents of the cargo 35 may be verified by interrogating this cargo 35 via an RFID interrogator 37.  Once the interrogator 37 has retrieved all
of the UPPC information, it may then verify receipt of all shipped goods via its own online shipping system 39 once the information has been transmitted thereto via the encoder interface 41.  The verification may be made via communication with the
registration authority 40 as illustrated in FIG. 4, or through communication with its own internal online shipping system as desired.
<BR><BR>The next phase of the product life cycle is the retail market which also integrates into the system of the instant invention as illustrated in FIG. 5.  A preferred retail system will utilize an RFID interrogator 51 which is linked to an
electronic transaction terminal point of sale system 53.  This point of sale system 53 is preferably tied to the retail store's inventory control system which utilizes the product's UPPC.  The point of sale system 53 may preferably communicate
automatically to the central data base or registration authority 40 to retrieve the product's password to enable operation thereof.  Once retrieved, the interrogator 51 transmits this password information to the electronic appliance, thereby enabling its
operation for the consumer 30.  Alternatively, the store may well decide to utilize its own internal password to enable and disable the operation of the appliances.  In such an event, the communication link to the registration authority 40 would not
necessarily be required, and could be replaced by a communication link to the store's own computerized data base which stores this information.
<BR><BR>Once purchased, the consumers will typically install the electronic appliance in their home or office environment 55 as desired.  Once in this environment, the consumer may register his purchase with the registration authority 40 by transmitting
the UPPC and other information via a modem 57, via voice communication over the telephone 59, or even via facsimile 61.  Once this information identifying the electronic appliance and the particular consumer is received by the central registration
authority 40, appropriate portions of this information is then communicated to the consumer warranty registration system 63 of the appropriate appliance manufacturer.
<BR><BR>To allow for the above described system operation, a preferred embodiment of the instant invention incorporates within an electronic appliance a RFID device 65 as illustrated in single line block diagrammatic form in FIG. 7.  As may be seen, the
RFID device 65 includes a coil type antenna 67 which receives the transmitted RF signal 69.  This transmitted RF signal includes both information and power, and serves both to energize the RFID device 65 as well as transmit information thereto.  As
discussed above, the RUID device 65 communicates with the interrogator (not shown) via a technique known as backscattering.  Preferably, this RFID device 65 is integrated into the electronic appliance and communicates directly with the security and
control logic 71 thereof.  This security and control logic 71 includes permanent data storage 73 as is conventional.  This permanent data storage 73 may maintain the UPPC and password information required by the system of the instant invention, or this
information may be stored in the RFID device 65 itself as is common with conventional RFID devices.  In any event, this information is coordinated through the security and control logic 71 of the appliance to disable operation of the appliance via a
disabling device 75.  This disabling device may take the form of control logic which prohibits operation of the appliance, hardware circuitry to prevent operation of the appliance, or a combination of both as appropriate for the particular appliance into
which the system is incorporated.
<BR><BR>A preferred embodiment of the instant invention also includes a communication bus 77 which interfaces with a communication interface 79 to allow hardware communication from the appliance to external devices.  This communication interface 79 may
be an external module which couples to the appliance through a communication bus port and cable connector 81.  Use of an external module allows for wide adaptability of the system to multiple communication platforms within the home or office. 
Alternatively, the communication interface may be integrated within the appliance as desired.
<BR><BR>An alternative embodiment of the instant invention utilizing an external RFID interface is illustrated in FIG. 8.  In this embodiment, an external RFID module 83 which contains the conventional components of a RFID device 65 and coil 67 is
interfaced to the appliance via a communication bus port and cable connector 85.  The information to and from the appliance will be transmitted through a communication bus 87 to the appliance's security and control logic 89.  In similar fashion to the
embodiment described above, the security and control logic 89 of the appliance interfaces with permanent data storage 91 and controls the operation of a disabling device 93 which may comprise both hardware and software components as appropriate.  The use
of the external RFID module 83 allows for wide applicability of the system of the instant invention as it does not specifically tie the appliance to any one particular frequency of operation (,See Background of the Invention section for discussion of the
available frequencies currently in use for RFID devices).  Such an external system allows a manufacturer to use its existing RFID equipment without having to worry if this is compatible with the shipping company or the retail outlet which may utilize
different RFID frequency systems.
<BR><BR>As illustrated in FIG. 9, the structure of this embodiment allows for other topology communication interfaces 95 to be coupled to the system via the cable connector and communication bus port 85.  These other topology communication interfaces 95
allow widespread applicability of the system of the instant invention as the requirement for RFID interfacing equipment is no longer needed at separate stages of the product life cycle.  For example, such an interface may allow direct modem communication
with the appliance.  This communication interface 95 may transmit the UPPC and password information to and from the appliance to allow the securing and control thereof.
<BR><BR>In an alternative embodiment, the securing of the appliance once in the possession of the consumer is accomplished once the appliance has been plugged in to the electrical distribution network in the home or office of the consumer, as illustrated
in simplified block diagrammatic single line form in FIG. 10.  As illustrated in this figure, the electric utility source 52 supplies electric power to the power distribution network 54 for electric power distribution throughout the home.  This
distribution network 54 comprises the wiring and electrical outlets, as well as the circuit breakers and switches commonly used in a home, office, or other consumer location.  As the individual appliances, illustrated as a television set 56, a video
player 58, a stereo 60, and a computer printer 62, are plugged into the distribution network 54 via their individual power cords (64, 66, 68, and 70 respectively), they receive electric power for operation, and are also now capable of individually
receiving the security information to place them into a secured state.  This security information is communicated to the individual appliances via the electric power distribution network 54 through a conventional electric power distribution
communications protocol, such as X-10 CEBus, or other appropriate communications protocol.  Preferably, the communication and coordination of the security information is contained within a consumer s personal computer 72 which is also plugged into the
electric power distribution network 54 by power cord 74.  Alternatively, or additionally, the security information may be communicated to the appliances via a portable hand held device 76 which is plugged into the electrical system via a common
electrical outlet by power and communication cord 78.  While FIG. 10 illustrates the use of both a personal computer 72 as well as a hand held device 76, one skilled in the art will recognize that the use of both of these is not required as much of their
functionality in this context is duplicative.  However, for enhanced security of the appliances, including the personal computer 72, the hand held device 76 may be utilized.
<BR><BR>When the personal computer 72 is utilized to transmit security information over the electrical power distribution network 54, it preferably includes a communications module 80 which is coupled to the electric power cord 74 as illustrated in block
diagrammatic form in FIG. 11.  As may be seen from this simplified block diagram, the communications module 80 interfaces directly with the main controller 82 of the PC 72.  In conventional manner, the PC 72 typically includes a display device 84, a
keyboard or other user interface 86, the capability of printing a hard copy 88 when desired.  The communication module 80 may vary depending upon the particular electric power system communications protocol chosen and may be, in a preferred embodiment,
an X-10 CM11A which includes an RS-232 serial port 90 as its communications interface with the controller 82.  Obviously, a different communication module 80 may be needed if a different communication protocol were chosen.
<BR><BR>With respect to the appliances.  FIG. 12 illustrates a simplified block diagram of an exemplary appliance constructed in accordance with the teachings of the instant invention.  This exemplary appliance 92 contains internal electronics 94 which
produce the appliance functionality, and which include a power supply section 96 which conditions the electric power from the AC power connection 98 for use by the control electronics 94.  In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 12, the communication
interface 100, which may be preferably an X-10 CM11A communications module, interfaces directly with the AC power connection 102 which is coupled to the electric power distribution network (not shown).  The communication interface module 100 preferably
communicates via an RS-232 serial port 104 with the security and control logic module 106, which may be a PIC16C73 microprocessor, or other appropriate processing means.
<BR><BR>The security and control logic 106 exchanges data with a permanent data storage device 108 which contains, for example, the unique appliance identification, the security code set by the system, etc. The security and control logic 106 also
coordinates the operation of a disabling device 110 which is preferably interposed between the electric power connection 102 to the electric power distribution network (not shown) and the connection of electric power 98 to the power module 96 of the
appliance 92.  In this way, the power to the appliance electronics 94 may be commanded on or off by the security and control logic 106 in response to communications transmitted over the electric power distribution network and received by the
communication interface 100.  While FIG. 12 illustrates the communication and control element 112 as internal to the appliance 92, one skilled in the art will recognize that such a communications element 112 may be externally mounted from the appliance
92 as an adapter.  This will allow for increased applicability of the system of the instant invention to existing appliances which do not have, or were not designed for internal communications and control mounting of element 112.  In such an embodiment,
the communication and control element 112 would form an adapter and could simply be interposed between the electrical wall outlet and the end of the power cord for the appliance.
<BR><BR>An alternate embodiment of an appliance 114 suitable for use with, and incorporating the teachings of the instant invention is illustrated in FIG. 13.  In this embodiment, the appliance 114 incorporates the security and control logic
functionality 116, the permanent data storage elements 118, and the disabling device or method 120 within the appliance functionality electronics 122.  Preferably, the communication interface 124 is still a separate module allowing for the
interchangeability with different communications protocols depending upon a consumer's preferences for his internal electric power distribution network communications system.  In this embodiment, the disabling device or method 120 performs the
functionality of disabling the appliance when commanded to do so, or in response to the security features of the system.  This functionality may be performed electronically within the microprocessor functionality control by disabling processor operation,
or may be a disabling type relay used in conjunction with the power supply for the appliance.  If this second option is employed, the relay should be installed such that stored parameters and presets within the appliances are not reset.  Other
implementations of the disabling functionality of element 120 may be utilized as appropriate, and it is the intent of this application to cover all such implementations.
<BR><BR>As described above, this system may also operate with a portable hand held unit 76, a simplified block diagram of which appears in FIG. 14.  As may be seen from this figure, the hand held unit 76 includes an AC power connection 126 which is
plugged into the standard wall outlet of the electric power distribution network (not shown).  The AC power coupled by this connector 126 is used conventionally by an internal power supply 128, and also is connected to the power line communication
interface module 130.  This power line communication interface module 130 may be of the type described above, or may be a universal communications protocol unit which allows for electronic communication over the electric power distribution network using
multiple communications protocols.  Preferably, however, this power line communication interface module 130 communicates via the X-10 communications protocol.
<BR><BR>The power line communication interface 130 communicates with and is controlled by a microcontroller 132, which may be preferably a PIC16C74 microcontroller.  This microcontroller 132 coordinates the control and security functions of the system,
and transmits and receives the required information over the electric power distribution network as described above.  The hand held unit 76 also includes a display, such as liquid crystal display 134, to allow display of required information to the user. Additionally, a user keypad 136 or other user interface is included to allow consumer input to the microcontroller 132.  The microcontroller 132 also interfaces with a permanent data storage module 138 which is used to store the security and
identification information of the coupled appliances installed within the system.
<BR><BR>While not required, the hand held unit 76 may preferably utilize the serial interface 140 of the microcontroller 132 to provide communication with, for example, a user's personal computer 144.  Preferably, the serial interface 140 will utilize an
RS-232 level translator 142 to provide adequate signal level communication with the user's personal computer.  Alternatively, the translator 142 may be replaced with a modem to provide remote communications via a telephone line.  In either case, the hand
held unit 76 may "dump" collected and stored data on appliance power usage, operating states, etc. To collect this data, the hand held unit is plugged into a wall socket for a period of time to allow it to communicate with and store data from the
appliances coupled to the system.
<BR><BR>An alternate embodiment of the portable unit 76 of the instant invention is illustrated in block diagrammatic form in FIG. 15.  In this embodiment, the power line communication interface module 146 is an external device which, through
replacement, allows the unit 76 to be utilized with multiple communication protocols.  This communication interface 146 may be a plug-in module or card which plugs into the unit 76, or may be a separate module which is interposed between the AC power
connection and the input to the unit 76 itself.  In a preferred embodiment of the instant invention, the communication interface module 146 is an X-10 CM11A power line communication interface module.  In this configuration of the hand held unit 76, the
serial interface 140 of the microcontroller 132 is utilized for the communication with the communication interface module 146.  Preferably, an RS-232 level translator 142 is utilized for this function.
<BR><BR>Having undertaken a description of the hardware system components in the electronic identification, control, and security system of the instant invention, the description now turns to the system functionality implemented thereby.  As the system
has many aspects and broad functionality, the following description will attempt to present a logical progression of the use of the system from original manufacture through purchase, installation, control, and attempted theft.
<BR><BR>As described above with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the security feature of the instant invention may preferably first be set by the appliance manufacturer to prevent internal theft, or theft during the transportation and final distribution to
the retail outlet.  This would be accomplished by the appliance manufacturer setting the internal security code to disable the appliance from operation.  The unit would then be in the secured state, requiring that the security code be input to unlock the
device and allow operation thereof.  In one embodiment of the instant invention, a separate lock and unlock security code could be implemented to control the security of the appliance.  Preferably however, the system would utilize a watch dog timer type
arrangement whereby periodic reception of the required security code would be needed to maintain the appliance in an operational mode.  That is to say, the appliance would continually or periodically look for the security code to be received from the
electrical power distribution network to ensure its continued existence at a particular consumer location.  If the appliance were not to receive the security code within its timeout period, it would automatically enter a non-operational security state,
precluding further operation of the appliance until such time as its security register were reset, or otherwise were to receive the proper security code.  In this way, theft of the appliance would be discouraged, because operation of the appliance would
be prevented without knowing the security code with which that particular appliance had been programmed.
<BR><BR>Once purchased by consumer, the retail store could either reset the security register such that the appliance would be in an unsecured state allowing operation of the appliance without the need for transmission of a security code signal, or the
retail store could provide the consumer with the preset security code to allow operation of the appliance in their home by utilizing the system of the instant invention.  With the system of the instant invention, the consumer may set the security code to
a common code for all appliances owned by that particular consumer encoupled to his electric power distribution network.  This would be accomplished either through the hand held unit described above or through the personal computer interface also
described above.
<BR><BR>In an embodiment of the instant invention whereby a personal computer is utilized to coordinate the security features of the instant invention, the personal computer preferably periodically transmits the security code over the electric power
distribution network to maintain all appliances coupled thereto in an operational state.  However, as this embodiment requires that the personal computer continuously, periodically transmit information over the electric power distribution network, the
system may alternately utilize a security set mode whereby an appliance would be enabled via transmission of the security code, and would continue to operate normally until the unit is unplugged from the electric power distribution network, or electric
power is otherwise removed therefrom.  Once electric power has been removed and reapplied to the appliance, the system would function to preclude operation of the appliance until reception of the security code as previously set by the system.  This would
preclude theft of the device by locking out further functionality of the appliance once it has been unplugged and removed from the residence of the consumer.  In this embodiment, the system would include a power delay timeout which prevents the lock out
from operating for a given period, e.g., 15 seconds, following the loss of power.  This power delay timeout prevents the necessity of initiating a password reset due to a power transient.  This type of functionality is particularly desirable when the
system is operated with the hand held unit described above.  In this way, the hand held unit need only be utilized initially upon installation of the appliance, and after each power loss to the appliance.
<BR><BR>To prevent the compromise of a single security code jeopardizing the security of all appliances either manufactured by an appliance manufacturer or installed within a consumer location, the system of the instant invention also contemplates the
ability to set individual security codes for individual appliances.  This is accomplished in the instant invention through the use of an individualized identification code stored within or otherwise associated with individual appliances.  In this way, a
matrix would be established within the system to associate each individual appliance with its particular security code.  Advantageously, the use of this individualized appliance identification code also allows for individualized control of the appliances
via the communication network over the electric power distribution system at the consumer location.  As described above, the individualized addressed message would be ignored by all other appliances coupled to the electric power distribution network, and
would only be acted upon by the particular appliance to which the message was directed.
<BR><BR>While the particular format of the individualized identification information for each appliance may take any suitable form which allows for individual identification and addressing of the appliance, a preferred format will be described
hereinbelow.  Specifically, a preferred implementation of the electronic identification information takes the form of a twenty byte word.  Preferably the word is segmented to allow for five bytes for UPC information identifying the make, model, etc. of
the appliance, four bytes to identify the manufacture date, one byte to identify the shut down current threshold information to allow the system of the instant invention to coordinate control and load shed operations which will be described more fully
hereinbelow, five bytes for the security code, and an additional five bytes for the lot number of the appliance.  While not all of this information is required to allow the aforementioned security functionality of the system, it is included for enhanced
control features as will be described below.
<BR><BR>Through the use of the individualized identification of the various appliances installed in a consumer location, the system of the instant invention may be utilized to coordinate the functionality of these appliances through the centralized
communication and control provided by the system.  Control of the individual components may be coordinated through the consumer's personal computer 72 (see FIG. 10), or may alternatively be coordinated through the hand held device 76.  Using either
implementation, the consumer would access the system of the instant invention, selecting the appliance ID, and performing the desired control functions thereon.  For example, the consumer may set hours of operation for individual appliances so that they
may be used only during certain hours of the day.  This programming would be maintained even if the particular appliance were removed from its current physical location within the consumer residence and moved to an alternate location.  Regardless of that
particular appliance's physical location within the consumer's residence, at the appointed hour the system would transmit an individualized addressed message disabling the appliance from further operation until the appointed hour for its reenablement. 
In addition to coordinated programming of the operation of various appliances, the system may be utilized to control the operation of the various appliances at that particular time.  As will be recognized by one skilled in the art, such coordinated
control of individual appliances through a personal computer would also allow for remote control of these appliances through external modem communications with the personal computer 72.
<BR><BR>The system of the instant invention may also be utilized to maintain performance information concerning each of the individual appliances utilized in the consumer location.  Particularly, the operational status of each of the appliances may be
monitored by the system of the instant invention through information transmitted from each of the individual appliances over the electrical distribution network to the central control of the system.  The system would then record the operational status of
each appliance, as well as any other information transmitted therefrom, in a database to allow coordination for, for example, built in test information, failure information, and warranty information.
<BR><BR>Additional operational information may be included in the functionality of the individual appliances, encoded with the device ID information of the instant invention, and transmitted over the electric power distribution network in accordance with
the teachings of the instant invention.  Specifically, the actual power usage as a function of time, average power usage, total amp-hour usage may all be monitored.  Furthermore, because the threshold states for on/off/failure as recommended by the
manufacturer may be stored by the system, this power monitoring may be used to prompt users to take certain actions, e.g., a high refrigerator current draw may signal the system to prompt the user to clean the refrigerator coils or seek service.  The
system may also utilize this information to automatically turn off an appliance if the recommended maximum power utilization levels are exceeded.  If an appliance is turned off in this manner, it may be reenabled without the requirement of a password
(non-secure re-energization) with or without a description of the reason why it turned off.
<BR><BR>One of the significant advantages of the individual identification information of the instant invention is that system control functionality accommodated by various electric power distribution network communication protocols such as X-10 and
CEBus is may be advantageously used without the need for reprogramming upon physical movement of appliances within a consumer location.  As an example, without individual identification of the consumer appliances, the physical movement of a particular
appliance from one electrical outlet to another necessitates the reprogramming of the system to recognize the appliance's new physical location.  With the system of the instant invention, this is no longer a problem as the individual appliance is
addressed by individual ID as opposed to by physical location as with other systems.  Therefore, the user is not tied to a particular configuration, but may freely rearrange the physical location of devices within the consumer location without having to
repeat a time consuming process of programming the entire centralized control system in response.
<BR><BR>Numerous modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description.  Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose
of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode for carrying out the invention.  Details of the structure and implementation of the various components described above can be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention, and
exclusive use of all modifications that come within the scope of the appended claims is reserved.
