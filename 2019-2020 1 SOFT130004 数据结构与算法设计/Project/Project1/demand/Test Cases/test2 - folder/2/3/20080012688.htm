<BR><BR>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<BR><BR>[0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent
     Application No. 60/818,535, filed on Jul. 6, 2006. The full disclosure of
     this provisional application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002] The present invention is directed to active and passive
     communication systems that allow for identification. The present
     invention is further directed to radio-frequency-identification (RFID)
     tag systems with improved security.
<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART
<BR><BR>[0003] RFID systems have proven very useful in a myriad of settings, such
     as goods identification and tagging for toll collections. There is an
     increasing need for the next generation of RFIDs to have higher
     confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and availability. TABLE 1
     shows a few examples of some existing and proposed RFID systems. The
     first RFID system, in row one, measures 0.4 mm by 0.4 mm in die size and
     contains a unique 128-bit identifier. It does not implement any security
     protection or communication collision detection. Rows two and three of
     TABLE 1 are two secure RFID systems which both implement proprietary
     cryptography with limited key-lengths. These proprietary ciphers are
     simplified and cryptographically weaker than standards such as the
     FIPS-197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It has been estimated that
     the design budget for cryptographic hardware in a next-generation secure
     RFID system is only about 2,000 gates. As a reference, one of the
     smallest available implementations for the Advanced Encryption Standard
     still requires over 3,500 gates. See, for example, M. Feldhofer et al.,
     "Strong Authentication for RFID Systems using the AES Algorithm," Proc.
     of the 2004 Cryptography Hardware and Embedded Systems Conference, LNCS
     3156. In order to reduce the implementation complexity and hardware
     requirements, systems have been proposed that use weak cryptography(such
     as short keys and/or simple ciphers). The use of weak cryptography,
     however, is not an adequate solution to the secure RFID problem. Such
     systems are susceptible to reverse engineering and brute-force attacks,
     as discussed, for example, in S. Bono et al., "Security Analysis of a
     cryptographically-enabled RFID Device," Proc. of the 14.sup.th USENIX
     Security Symposium (USENIX05), August 2005.

<BR><BR>[0004] Having a power-limited environment for cryptographic operations has
     a second important consequence; the operations have to run at low speed.
     This is because the power consumption of a digital circuit is
     proportional to its clock frequency. Typically, the clock of digital RFID
     hardware runs slower than 100 KHz. According to the ISO/EIC 18000
     standard, an RFID must reply to its reader within 320 .mu.s. At a digital
     clock of 100 KHz, this leaves only 32 cycles for encryption, in the most
     optimal case. The implementation of standard cryptographic operations in
     the power- and area-constrained RFID environment requires a much larger
     cycle budget. For example, Feldhofer et al., presented an implementation
     of AES for RFIDs that needs 992 clock cycles for a 128-bit encryption. In
     J. Wolkerstorfer, "Scaling ECC Hardware to a minimum," 2005 Workshop on
     Cryptographic Advances in Secure Hardware (CRASH), September 2005, it was
     presented that a public-key processor for RFIDs based on elliptic-curve
     cryptography needs 426,000 clock cycles for a scalar elliptic-curve
     multiplication on a 192-bit field. Consequently, digital cryptography in
     RFID causes a severe latency-problem that fails to meet present-day
     standards.
<BR><BR>[0005] Recent work in so-called `light-weight` protocols tries to improve
     this by alleviating the requirements of encryption or even eliminating
     them altogether. The HB+ protocol, for example, uses a protocol modeled
     after human authentication. It uses repeated challenges directly derived
     from the shared key K. Unfortunately the HB+ protocol is not resistant
     against active attacks. See, for example, "An Active Attack Against
     HB+--A Provably Secure Lightweight <B><I>Authentication Protocol,</I></B> Cryptology
     ePrint Archive 2005, publication 237.
<BR><BR>[0006] Besides HB+, several good proposals have been presented recently,
     all of which use a cryptographic primitive (hash function, cipher,
     message authentication, and so forth). The hash-lock scheme from S. Sarma
     et al., "RFID systems and security and privacy implications," Proceedings
     of the 2002 Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems Workshop
     (CHES02), pp. 454-469, Springer, 2002, uses the concept of a lock based
     on hash-functions. The YA-TRAP protocol from C. Tsudik, "YA-TRAP: Yet
     Another Trivial RFID <B><I>Authentication Protocol,</I></B>" Proceedings of the
     International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications,
     PerCom 2006, relies on time-stamping RFIDs and a hash function to prevent
     unauthorized tracking.
<BR><BR>[0007] Given the above discussed applications, there does not seem to be
     an easy solution that will make cryptographic primitives in
     authentication protocols obsolete. Rather, what is needed is a
     significantly more efficient implementation of those secure protocols.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0008] It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an RFID
     tag with secure authentication that allows only legitimate users to
     access its content and offers a wide range of applications such as
     electronic car keys, electronic purses, and anti-counterfeiting. To
     achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to
     a radio-frequency-identification system which includes an RFID tag and an
     RFID reader, where the RFID reader is configured to communicate with the
     RFID tag using time-hopped pulse-position modulation and ultra-wideband
     modulation.
<BR><BR>[0009] Current secure implementations of RFID rely on cryptographic
     hardware. This results in complex hardware with high power dissipation.
     In addition, existing passive RFID systems rely on simple coding and
     modulation schemes using narrowband radio frequencies, which can be
     easily eavesdropped or jammed. The present invention is directed to
     systems that secure the physical communications between RFIDs and
     readers, rather than to secure the contents of RFIDs by encryption. The
     present invention uses time-hopped pulse-position modulation (TH-PPM) and
     ultra wideband (UWB) modulation, which makes eavesdropping extremely
     difficult. The method of the present invention simplifies the
     cryptographic requirements or even eliminates them altogether, while
     offering the same level of security as existing passive RFIDs.
<BR><BR>[0010] Preferably, the time-hopped pulse-position modulation may include
     sending from the RFID tag to the RFID reader a series of pulses in time
     slots selected by the RFID tag through a pseudo-random generator. The
     RFID reader may also be configured to communicate with the RFID tag
     through a narrowband communication, where that narrowband communication
     may provide power and command signals to the RFID tag. The RFID tag may
     communicate with the RFID reader using pulses of approximately 60 .mu.s
     in width and/or time slots of approximately 950 ps in width.
<BR><BR>[0011] Additionally, the present invention is also directed to a
     radio-frequency-identification system having an RFID tag and an RFID
     reader, where the RFID reader is configured to communicate with the RFID
     tag using narrowband communication initially and subsequently through
     broadband communication. The broadband communication may include
     ultra-wideband modulation and time-hopped pulse-position modulation.
<BR><BR>[0012] The present invention is also directed to a method of communicating
     within a radio-frequency-identification system having the steps of
     sending a narrowband signal from an RFID reader to an RFID tag and
     receiving data signals from the RFID tag to the RFID reader through
     broadband communication using time-hopped pulse-position modulation and

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
<BR><BR>[0018] A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be set forth
     in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference
     numerals refer to like elements or operational steps throughout.
<BR><BR>[0019] Since the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) allocation of
     a UWB spectrum in the range of 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz in 2002, UWB has
     gained phenomenal interest in academia and industry. Compared to
     traditional narrowband communication systems, UWB has several advantages
     including high data-rate, low average radiated power, and simple RF
     circuitry. Many of these potential advantages are a direct consequence of
     UWB's large instantaneous bandwidth. Shannon's theorem states that the
     channel capacity C is given as B log.sub.2(1+SNR), where B is the
     bandwidth and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio, as discussed in J. G.
     Proakis, Digital Communications, McGraw-Hill, 1995. As the bandwidth B is
     much larger (on the order of several GHz) for UWB than for a narrowband
     signal, the SNR can be much smaller for UWB to achieve the same data
     rate. Therefore, UWB is often able to recover data, even if the signal
     power is close to the noise level. In other words, the presence of UWB
     signals is harder to detect than narrowband signals.
<BR><BR>[0020] The IEEE 802.15 WPAN task group has recognized the potential of UWB
     for low data rate applications, and is in the process of standardizing
     the physical layer. Numerous UWB radio architectures targeting low-power
     low data-rate UWB applications including RFIDs have been proposed. G. P.
     Hancke et al., "An RFID Distance Bounding Protocol," Proceedings of
     SecureComm, pp. 67-73, 5-9 Sep. 2005, presented a paper on securing RFIDs
     using UWB, where the authors suggested that measuring the signal
     propagation delay between an RFID and the reader using UWB. If the delay
     exceeds a certain bound, the system signals a possible attack.
<BR><BR>[0021] UWB signaling can be carrier-based or impulse-based, and
     impulse-based UWB is more suitable for the RFID due to its simple
     hardware. Impulse-based UWB is based on a train of narrow pulses (which
     are typically a few tens to hundreds picoseconds wide). Various
     modulation schemes such as on-off keying, pulse amplitude modulation,
     pulse position modulation (PPM), and binary phase shift keying are
     available for UWB. A binary PPM scheme has 2 distinctive time positions
     in a time slot, and one pulse carries 1 bit of information. In a
     preferred embodiment, PPM is adopted due to its low hardware complexity.
<BR><BR>[0022] A k-bit time hopping PPM (TH-PPM) allocates 2 k time slots for each
     bit and hops time slots between pulses. FIG. 1(a) shows an example TH-PPM
     scheme with four time slots in each cycle. The first pulse occupies the
     second time slot, the second pulse the first slot, and the third pulse
     the fourth slot in the figure. Like any other PPM, the position of a
     pulse within a time slot carries the bit information for TH-PPM. For
     example, a pulse aligned to the start of a slot represents logic 0 (FIG.
     1 (b)). A pulse delayed by .DELTA. with respect to the start of a time
     slot carries logic 1 (FIG. 1(c)). So far, time-hopping has been used in
     communications for two purposes, multiple access and/or spreading of the
     spectrum. A multiple access scheme assigns orthogonal time hopping
     sequences to all users, so that the users can share the channel
     simultaneously. When a train of pulses are time-hopped, it spreads the
     spectrum to yield so-called spreading gain. The present application
     introduces a new application of time-hopping, which is to secure physical
     layer communications through time-hopping.
<BR><BR>[0023] To demodulate extremely narrow UWB pulses, a receiver should
     correlate incoming pulse signals with a template signal. The time slot of
     an incoming pulse is known a priori for a conventional TH-PPM scheme. The
     receiver performs two correlations starting at two different time spots,
     one at t=0 as for the case in FIG. 1(b) expecting a logic value 0 for the
     incoming signal and the other at t=.DELTA. as in FIG. 1(c) expecting
     logic 1. One of the two correlation operations will capture the received
     signal energy, while the other one will only correlate noise. If the time
     slots of pulses are assigned in a pseudo random manner, the eavesdropper
     should perform correlations for all possible time slots. If the total
     number of time slots is sufficiently large and each time slot is
     sufficient small, eavesdropping of TH-PPM communications is practically
     impossible.
<BR><BR>[0024] FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of our proposed secure RFID system.
     Like existing RFID systems, the downlink from a reader 201 to an RFID 200
     relies on narrowband communications 202. The downlink sends commands to
     an RFID and delivers power 203. Narrowband communication is adopted to
     maximize power transfer to the RFID. Note that the information over this
     link can be easily detected and decoded, but the information, i.e.,
     commands, is trivial
<BR><BR>[0025] According to the present invention, the uplink from an RFID to the
     reader adopts UWB communications and a TH-PPM scheme 208. This link
     transfers the unique and critical ID stored in the RFID's memory 204 to
     the reader, and requires protection. A pseudo-random generator (PRNG) 206
     generates the modulation code, i.e., the time slot of a pulse. A PRNG
     generates pseudorandom numbers which results in a random sequence. In
     certain embodiments, after the completion of the read cycle, the RFID
     stores the last code (which is the status of the PRNG) in a non-volatile
     memory 205. It should be noted that such storage makes the system more
     difficult to hack, but is not essential to secure system operation. In
     those certain embodiments, when the RFID goes through another readout
     cycle, it generates a set of new pseudorandom modulation codes, one at a
     time, using the previous code stored in the memory. The newly generated
     codes select the time slots of the pulses to transfer the ID 207. The
     secrecy of the RFID transmission lies in the fact that it is hard to
     intercept the pulse-train if one does not know the time slots of the
     pulses. This is so because UWB pulses are very narrow (about 100 ps
     wide), and detection of UWB pulses require precise timing
     synchronization.
<BR><BR>[0026] Examples of transmission for the secure RFID system of the present
     invention are provided below. The basic transmission frame format is
     discussed, followed by a security analysis. Next, the communication
     protocol is extended to enable simultaneous operation of multiple readers
     and multiple RFID.
<BR><BR>[0027] FIG. 3 illustrates a frame for the transmission of a single ID. The
     transmission needs to complete within 10 ms, similar to present-day
     non-secure RFIDs, in which a preamble occupies 2 ms and the ID 8 ms. The
     first 32 bits of the frame is a preamble, as shown in FIG. 3(a), which is
     required to synchronize the reader. These pulses occupy the same time
     slot (such as the first time slot) of each cycle. Next, a pulse train of
     128 bits follows, each pulse position being modulated pseudo-randomly by
     a PRNG. The cycle time, i.e., time window of a pulse, in this example, is
     62.5 .mu.s. The system in FIG. 3 uses a 16-bit pulse-position code,
     resulting in 2.sup.16 (=65,536) time slots, as illustrated in FIG. 3(b),
     with each slot 954 ps long. This slot length is long enough for a pulse
     not to interfere with the pulse from the next time slot.
<BR><BR>[0028] Initially, the reader sends a narrowband RF carrier to the passive
     tag, which allows the tag to power up. The power-up stage may require a
     few milliseconds. When the reader is ready to query the tag, it briefly
     interrupts the RF carrier. This small gap does not cause power-loss for
     the tag, but can be used to reset the system.
<BR><BR>[0029] The tag clock, which is derived from the narrowband carrier signal,
     is synchronous to the carrier clock of the reader, but delayed by .DELTA.
     seconds, where .DELTA. is the sum of the round trip flight time of the
     radio signal between the reader and the tag and the processing time for a
     tag to detect the carrier and send the first pulse. The processing time
     is fixed and known a priori, so it does not affect the window size of the
     synchronization time search.
<BR><BR>[0030] The attacks on an RFID fall into three categories: physical attacks
     on the RFID electronics themselves, passive attacks based on
     eavesdropping the RFID transmissions, and active attacks by disturbing or
     enhancing the RFID transmissions. In this application, the focus is on
     the latter two attacks, passive and active. It should be noted that the
     risk for physical attacks for systems according to the present invention
     is similar to that of existing RFIDs.
<BR><BR>[0031] Passive Attacks: Using FIG. 3, the risk that an attacker is able to
     `pick up` the transmissions of an UWB RFID is illustrated. Suppose that
     an attacker successfully synchronizes his/her reader (or a UWB receiver)
     using the preamble. A brute-force attack is to capture every signal
     within the remaining 8 ms transmission window of an RFID. To capture
     enough energy for each pulse with duration of 100 ps, it would be
     necessary to capture at least ten samples for a pulse. This requires
     about 168 megasamples (which is 20 samples for each time slot, for 65,536
     slots per pulse and 128 pulses per read cycle)--this is a very expensive
     measurement in terms of complexity and instrumentation cost. More
     importantly, the ADC (analog-to-digital converter) used to sample these
     pulses should operate at the sampling rate of 100 gigasamples per second,
     which is not feasible for current technologies.
<BR><BR>[0032] An alternative attack strategy would be to read a certain fixed
     time slot, for example, always to read the first slot of each cycle, and
     perform multiple RFID read operations until each pulse of 128 bits hits
     the time slot at least once. This would need, on average, 65,536/2 read
     operations for the above example protocol shown in FIG. 2. A
     straightforward countermeasure is to increase the number of time slots
     per cycle, but as this also increases the clock frequency of the PPM
     modulator and hence the power dissipation, it is not an optimal choice.
     Another countermeasure is as follows: deactivate the RFID after a certain
     number of read operations, defined by its expected lifetime. This scheme
     is still much simpler than cryptographic operations in hardware.
<BR><BR>[0033] Active Attacks: An attacker may attempt to modify the UWB
     transmission between the RFID and the reader. This kind of attack
     requires disruption of the signal exactly at the position where an UWB
     pulse is located, and hence requires the knowledge on the modulation
     code. If the objective would be only to jam the signal, a transmitter
     should generate a distortion pulse at each possible pulse position. This
     requires a significant amount of transmission power in the GHz range,
     which is very expensive in hardware.
<BR><BR>[0034] While it is not possible to claim that secure UWB will perfectly
     resist attacks, it can reasonably be assumed that such attacks are
     difficult to mount. In addition, the eavesdropping protection offered by
     UWB is much cheaper in hardware and is complementary to traditional
     cryptography used in RFIDs.
<BR><BR>[0035] When multiple readers access the same UWB-RFID, they have to
     synchronize their internal PRNG to that of the RFID. The protocol shown
     in FIG. 4 can handle this problem. Both a reader 201 and an RFID 200 use
     the same initialization vector for the PRNG as a shared secret. When the
     reader requests to read the RFID, the RFID replies by sending a preamble
     followed by the number of times that it has already been read, the read
     count N. This number is transmitted using a fixed pulse-position code,
     and allows the reader to synchronize an internal PRNG to the same
     sequence as the RFID. Next, the RFID transmits the actual ID, this time
     using pulse-position modulation. While this protocol allows an attacker
     to know how many times an RFID has been read, it safeguards the actual
     ID.
<BR><BR>[0036] A strong point of using UWB modulation is that multiple RFIDs can
     coexist and transmit simultaneously. Indeed, given appropriate reader
     hardware, multiple concurrent RFID transmissions can be detected since
     they can overlap at the physical layer without conflicts. It is expected
     that this property can lead to considerable simplification of the
     so-called tree-walking protocols required for narrowband RFIDs.
<BR><BR>[0037] While a preferred embodiment has been set forth in detail above,
     those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other embodiments
     can be realized within the scope of the invention. For example, numerical
     values are illustrative rather than limiting, as is the order in which
     steps are carried out. Therefore, the present invention should be
     construed as limited only by the appended claims.
