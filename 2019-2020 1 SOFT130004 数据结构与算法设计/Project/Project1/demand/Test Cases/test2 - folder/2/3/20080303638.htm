<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0003]1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>[0004]This invention relates in general to portable digital patient
     assistant systems and related methods. The invention further relates to
     providing patient aid and preventing medical errors as well as to
     protecting the pharmaceutical supply chain from drug counterfeiters to
     thereby ensure that patients as end-users ingest only legitimately
     manufactured medicinal drugs. In particular, this invention includes the
     application of RFID technologies to provide an effective way of
     determining whether a medication is authentic. More specifically and in
     addition to the above, but without restriction to the particular
     embodiments hereinafter described in accordance with the best mode of
     practice, this invention relates to RFID-based systems for monitoring
     patients use of ingestible medications and for preventing the
     distribution of counterfeit drugs.
<BR><BR>[0005]2. General Discussion and Related Art
<BR><BR>[0006]Patient Aid and Medical Errors Discussion: The Institute of Medicine
     estimates that as many as 18,000 Americans a year die prematurely because
     they do not have health insurance. More alarming is that five times that
     many die each year from hospital infections, wrong prescriptions, and
     medical errors. Most of these people are insured. The statistics in the
     Institute of Medicine report, which were based on two large studies,
     suggest that medical errors are the eighth leading cause of death among
     Americans, with error-caused deaths each year in hospitals alone
     exceeding those from motor vehicle accidents (43,458), breast cancer
     (42,297), or AIDS (16,516). Medical malpractice statistics on pharmacy
     errors show as many at 98,000 people die every year from medical and
     medication errors. One study reported that as many as five percent of
     prescriptions filled each year are incorrect. Children are most at risk.
     The medical statistics show that the potential for adverse drug events in
     children are three times higher than for adults. These statistics show
     the potential to be even higher for babies in neonatal units.
<BR><BR>[0007]Pharmacists can make prescription errors by providing a patient with
     the wrong drug, the wrong dosage, or the wrong instructions for taking
     the drug. These types of errors occur even when the doctor's prescription
     was correct.
<BR><BR>[0008]The American Hospital Association has identified some common types
     of medication errors. These include firstly, incomplete patient
     information such as, for example, not knowing about a patient's
     allergies, other medicines they are taking, previous diagnoses, and lab
     results. This lack of information is due in large part to the fact that
     the previous diagnosis, allergy warning, and lab results are maintained
     only in paper record or are not otherwise distributed to those with a
     need to know.
<BR><BR>[0009]A second common type of medical error results from unavailable drug
     information such as for example, lack of up-to-date warnings. Updates
     oftentimes are not transferred from one hospital to another hospital
     (development of a resistant bacterial infection), from the doctor's
     office to the pharmacist (new allergies), or from one doctor's office to
     another's (the patient is already on an antidepressant or the patient is
     shopping for narcotics). The device and methods of the present invention
     will keep tract of all the above and will eliminate errors of this
     nature.
<BR><BR>[0010]And a third type of general common medical error is miscommunication
     of drug orders. This may result from poor handwriting, confusion between
     drugs with similar names, misuse of zeroes and decimal points, confusion
     of metric and other dosing units, and inappropriate abbreviations. In
     this area, one of the common errors is confusion with the drug name. For
     example Celebrex for arthritis may be easily confused Celexa an
     anti-depressant, or Cerebyx an anti-convulsant. The current system relies
     on strict labeling to avoid sound-alike or look-alike drugs, and even
     similar looking drug packaging and trade dress. The current system,
     however, falls short in preventing such errors because, for one thing,
     lack of appropriate labeling often occurs in the supply chain as a drug
     is prepared and repackaged into smaller units. In this case, even if the
     original packaging has a correct bar code, this bar code cannot be
     inserted onto the pill or even transfer to the smaller packaging. In
     addition to these repackaging issues, the system in current use suffers
     from environmental factors such as lighting, heat, noise, and work flow
     interruptions that can distract distribution personnel and health
     professionals from their intended tasks. The RFID solution and device of
     the present invention will solve this problem by eliminating this type of
     confusion.
<BR><BR>[0011]It is believed by those in the hospital profession that the Veterans
     Administration (VA) system is well ahead of most hospitals in protecting
     patients from medication errors. The VA has adopted a system in which a
     nurse scans a barcode printed on the patient's bracelet, indicating the
     name and dose of each medication the patient should be receiving. The
     nurse then scans the pre-packaged medication to ensure a correct match.
<BR><BR>[0012]Recent reports have concluded that patients in VA hospitals are also
     more likely to receive optimal care as compared to patients in other
     hospitals. In the late 1990s, the VA re-engineered its healthcare system,
     using information technology to track and measure the care each patient
     is given. The result is significantly higher compliance with best
     practices.
<BR><BR>[0013]According to a 2003 study in the New England Journal of Medicine,
     patients in VA hospitals received better care in 12 out of 13 measures
     compared to Medicare-eligible patients in nongovernmental hospitals. The
     American Customer Service Satisfaction Index (based at the University of
     Michigan) shows that patients in VA hospitals are more satisfied with
     their care (84% vs. 74%) than patients in private-sector hospitals.
<BR><BR>[0014]Thus the inventors hereof believe that broadly implementing further
     technical solutions to address patient aid and medical errors will
     advance the art of promoting health and wellness to all of those in need.
<BR><BR>[0015]Monitoring Patients Use of Ingestible Medications: More than 100,000
     medication errors a year are reported to U.S. Pharmacopeia, an
     organization that develops standards for drugs. Current estimates are low
     because many errors are not reported, says the Institute of Medicine, a
     private advisory group to the U.S. Federal Government. Medication errors
     kill more than 7,000 people each year in the United States, according to
     a study based on death certificates.
<BR><BR>[0016]The U.S. Food and Drug Administration analyzed reports of deaths
     caused by medication errors that were reported to the agency from 1993 to
     1998. About 41% involved an incorrect dosage and about 16% involved
     giving the wrong drug or delivering the correctly prescribed drug in the
     wrong manner.
<BR><BR>[0017]Many errors occur in hospitals, although estimates relating thereto
     vary widely. People getting prescriptions filled at a pharmacy can be
     affected by such hospital errors as well. According to the Institute for
     Safe Medication Practices, one prescription out of every 20 filled at a
     U.S. pharmacy has an error.
<BR><BR>[0018]In the past, patients were asked to read the prescription label,
     make sure the medication name and dosage are what the doctor prescribed,
     and look at the pill for size, color, and name. Then, the patient has to
     maintain the schedule so not to take more or less of a dosage than
     prescribed. The patients were also advised to keep medicine in original
     containers and to not take any medicine in the dark. But unfortunately,
     patients occasionally cannot remember which dose they have taken and the
     current manner of remembering is to put the medicines in special boxes or
     used special mechanical reminder devices. Also some patients put all the
     daily medicines into one bottle. This can result in mixing and confusing
     the drugs if they have about the same color (pink pills and peach-color
     pills can look similar for visually-impaired patients). With
     implementation and application of the RFID-based device and methods of
     the present invention, all of this can be eliminated.
<BR><BR>[0019]An unfortunate reality is that may of our veterans returning from
     service have developed drug additions. Post-traumatic stress disorder and
     related physical injuries may be treated with Xanax, an anti-anxiety
     drug, and the potent painkiller methadone. Such cases are found for both
     service members and civilians. At times, some patients are allowed to
     administer their own drugs even though they may have a history of drug
     abuse. In one reported situation of this nature, the patient died as a
     result of a self-administered over-dose of methadone. The inventors
     hereof believe that implementation and application of the RFID-based
     devices, systems, and methods disclosed herein can reduce or completely
     prevent this type tragic and unnecessary lose of life.
<BR><BR>[0020]According to the Institute of Medicine, a research organization that
     advises the U.S. Congress, the typical hospital patient is given the
     wrong medication or the wrong dose at least once a day. It is now further
     reported that these types of mistakes are less likely to happen at a
     hospital run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As documented in
     recent surveys and evaluations, VA hospitals have undergone a notable
     turnaround in the last decade. On average, VA hospitals now earn higher
     marks for patient safety and quality of care than most other hospitals in
     the United States.
<BR><BR>[0021]One recent technology, Computer Physician Order Entry (CPOE), is
     designed to prevent doctors from prescribing the wrong medication. Under
     implementation of CPOE, the doctor enters prescriptions at a computer
     terminal rather than by use of pen and pad. The computer identifies
     incorrect doses or a medication that conflict with other prescribed
     medications currently in use by the patient. When the computer sounds an
     alarm which indicates some type of problem, the physician has to override
     it. It has been further reported that in Australia, Britain, New Zealand,
     and much of Western Europe, hospitals have adopted CPOE, but most U.S.
     hospitals have resisted. An exception is the VA, which has installed CPOE
     nationwide.
<BR><BR>[0022]The VA has also pushed ahead of most hospitals in the U.S. by
     investing in electronic medical records. This allows a patient's medical
     history to be accessed in a few seconds. It is reported that the VA
     database is a resource for medical researchers and the envy of the
     private sector.
<BR><BR>[0023]Thus, by these examples, the inventors hereof remain convinced that
     technological solutions can and do improve the state and practice of
     medicine and delivery of medical services. Nonetheless while bar coding
     and electronic record keeping have proven significant in reducing medical
     errors associated with ingesting incorrect medicinal drugs, the inventors
     hereof believe that implementation and application of the RFID solutions
     disclosed herein will advance the art in a manner that will, inter alia,
     further reduce costs, reduce human error, and substantially improve
     quality of life issues relating to health and wellness including saving
     lives that otherwise would be lost.
<BR><BR>[0024]Counterfeit Drug Background: As the pharmaceutical arts and sciences
     have developed in recent years, the number and effectiveness of useful
     drugs and medications available to the general public has increased
     dramatically. This advancement in the art coupled with an increase in
     patient awareness of useful drugs brought about by wider advertising, has
     lead to greater sales and distribution of beneficial drugs. Few would
     question the benefits modern drugs bring to society today. And it is
     expected that 21.sup.st century pharmaceutical science will continue to
     provide remarkable new drugs with substantial increases in effectiveness.
<BR><BR>[0025]Some current examples of beneficial and effective drugs that have
     had great commercial success in the market place would include Ambien,
     Lipitor, and Cipro; erectile-dysfunction drugs such as Viagra, Cialis,
     and Levitra; and a wide variety of FDA approved anti-HIV and AIDS drugs
     such as Atripla which is a multi-class combination product, Truvada a
     Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI), Sustiva which is a
     Nonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), Aptivus a Protease
     Inhibitor (PI), and Fuzeon a Fusion Inhibitor.
<BR><BR>[0026]As is often the case where there is great success in industry,
     however, there are those in society who would desire to benefit as
     free-riders on the labor of successful industrious interests. Thus in the
     pharmaceutical industry, there exists counterfeit drug manufactures. It
     has been reported that some of these illegitimate manufactures have
     recently switched from making harmful illegal drugs such as cocaine and
     ecstasy to making counterfeit versions of commercially successful
     prescription drugs because the risks are lower and the profits higher.
<BR><BR>[0027]Drug counterfeiting occurs, for example, when an illegitimate
     manufacture procures empty gelatin capsules, fills them with a useless
     powder, packages the bogus capsules in bottles with printed fake labels
     that may include trademark infringements, and then sells them into the
     pharmaceutical supply chain by various means. These counterfeit drugs
     then enter legitimate channels of distribution and end up in our
     pharmacies and drug stores where a typical pharmacist is not equipped to
     distinguish authentic product from the ineffective fraudulent impostors
     manufactured by counterfeiters.
<BR><BR>[0028]It has been recently reported that drug counterfeiters have garnered
     $35 billion in illegitimate black-market profits. And while the World
     Health Organization estimates that up to 10 percent of the medications
     sold globally are actually counterfeit, several other reports further
     indicate that drug counterfeiting has been on an increasing trend.
<BR><BR>[0029]Those concerned with this problem have been making some efforts to
     provide a solution. On the legislative front, representatives from the
     U.S. Congress have proposed increased criminal penalties for
     counterfeiting prescription drugs. On the regulatory side, the Food and
     Drug Administration (FDA) has recognized the problem and has encouraged
     drug manufacturers to track their shipments in the supply chain. Certain
     currant tracking methods, however, have proven difficult to implement
     successfully because according to some of these methods each individual
     bottle of medication requires bar code reading by an inspector and such
     inspection is not initiated unless there is at least some suspicion of
     counterfeiting. As an improved tracking technology, Radio Frequency
     Identification (RFID) has recently been proposed. Due to high costs,
     however, implementation of RFID has not been widely employed. It has been
     reported that so far, only limited shipments of expensive drugs like the
     painkiller Oxycontin contain RFID tags on their labels.
<BR><BR>[0030]The inventors hereof believe that in view of the current undesirable
     situation regarding drug counterfeiters coupled with the expectation that
     21.sup.st century pharmaceutical science will perhaps even accelerate the
     rate of innovating new and useful medications, the problem of counterfeit
     drugs entering legitimate channels of distribution will only worsen in
     time unless further legislative, regulatory, and technical solutions are
     provided.
<BR><BR>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0031]For the convenience of presentation and readability, this Objects
     and Summary of the Invention section is divided into three parts
     corresponding to the above three parts of the General Discussion section.
<BR><BR>Portable Digital Patient Assistant
<BR><BR>[0032]It is therefore, in view of the above, an object of one principal
     aspect of the present invention to provide patient aid.
<BR><BR>[0033]Another object of this invention is to improve quality of life
     issues relating to health and wellness.
<BR><BR>[0034]It is a further object of the present invention to prevent medical
     errors.
<BR><BR>[0035]Still another object of the present invention is to implement RFID
     technologies in a hand-held device to assist a patient in providing aid
     and preventing medical errors.
<BR><BR>[0036]Yet another object of the present invention is to implement RFID
     technologies in a wearable device to assist a patient in providing aid
     and preventing medical errors.
<BR><BR>[0037]An additional object of the present invention is to enable various
     methods that utilize a portable digital patient assistant to assist a
     patient in providing aid and preventing medical errors.
<BR><BR>[0038]Still yet a further object of the present invention is to facilitate
     patient initiated communications with medical and insurance providers by
     use of a portable digital patient assistant.
<BR><BR>[0039]Yet a further object of the present invention is to facilitate
     interactive patient communications with medical and insurance providers
     by use of a portable digital patient assistant.
<BR><BR>[0040]Still another additional object of the present invention is to
     facilitate automatic communications with medical and insurance providers
     by use of a portable digital patient assistant when a patient is unable
     to initiate same.
<BR><BR>[0041]These and other objects are attained in accordance with the present
     invention wherein there is provided an RFID-based Portable Digital
     Patient Assistant (PDPA) computer. The PDPA of the present invention is
     preferably wrist-watch-sized and worn like a wrist watch or,
     alternatively, may be of a somewhat larger size like a cell phone, PDA,
     or MP3 player, for example, and clipped onto the patient in a typical
     fashion. The PDPA includes an embedded RFID tag reader with, preferably,
     at least a 2 foot range capable of reaching an RFID tag in a patient's
     stomach.
<BR><BR>[0042]The PDPA of the present invention stores the patient's complete
     physical records, billing, and insurance information as well as medical
     data and history and other information such as emergency telephone
     numbers. Physical records may include essential information such as the
     patient's Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and actual body weight which may be
     used by a pharmacy, for example, to calculate the correct dose of a
     prescribed medication. As one of skill would appreciate, prescribing the
     correct dosage based on body weight is particularly important in
     pediatric patients. Medical data and history stored and maintained in the
     PDPA may include, for example, X-ray, MRI, MRA, and pathology of biopsy
     files as well as results from blood and other tests. Thus according to
     one aspect of the present invention as embodied in the PDPA, an
     individual who so chooses may carry on his person, as stored and
     maintained in the PDPA, any and all relevant personal information
     including physical records, billing and insurance information, and
     medical history. In any case where the patient becomes unconscious, this
     data may be life saving since it is available real time to any other
     person including loved-ones, care-takers, emergency medical personnel
     such as paramedics, nurses, nurse practitioners, and doctors to name a
     few. According to certain information access aspects of the present
     invention relating hereto, in some embodiments of the PDPA only
     authorized persons may be given access to the information stored in an
     individual patient's PDPA. In alternate embodiments, certain third
     parties such as personal physicians may have full access, while others
     have partial access. The inventors hereof have provided implementations
     for some cases, for example emergency medical personnel, where a third
     party unaffiliated with the patient is equipped with a universal access
     key or code so that in the case of a medical emergency such medical
     personnel do not require pre-programmed authorization to access the
     patient's information. This is analogous to hotel security personnel
     having a pass key for all the rooms in a hotel.
<BR><BR>[0043]One advantage of the present invention is that when it is adopted
     early in life, a full medical history may be easily maintained
     notwithstanding changes of address and having to see different doctors as
     a result thereof. Thus the inventors hereof envision that parents of
     young children maintain a pediatric PDPA for each of their children. This
     may be started at the time of birth of the child. When the child reaches
     an age of maturity, the parent may then release the child's full medical
     history, as electronically maintained in a secure PDPA, to the care and
     custody of the adult son or daughter. In the case where the PDPA was used
     since the time of birth, this medical information will thus be full and
     complete. In this manner, no matter how many different children's doctors
     the child had visited while under parental care and supervision, when the
     child starts visiting doctors on his or her own account, say for example
     at college on university campus, the new doctor will have the full
     records of the young adult patient as from the time of birth in the case
     of early adoption or in the case where the PDPA was back-filled at a
     later time with complete information since the time of birth.
<BR><BR>[0044]In an outpatient setting, whenever prescriptions are renewed and the
     prescribed drug is metabolized by either the liver or the kidneys, the
     last lab data (liver function or kidney function test) can be monitored
     by the PDPA to avoid overdose as well as to prevent liver or kidney
     toxicity. In addition to this aspect, information about previous
     bacterial infections with resistance to certain antibiotics (for example,
     Methicillin-Resistant Staphyococcus Aureus or MRSA) can be uploaded to
     the PDPA of the present invention. Whenever a patient is admitted for
     systemic or focal infection (cellulitis, bacteremia, and others), the
     current standard of care is to give a broad spectrum antibiotic while
     waiting for test results of the culture and sensitivity test which
     results can take three days to obtain. Then the antibiotic choice is
     adjusted to comport with the result of the sensitivity test. Patients
     with repeated Staphylococcus infections can develop resistance to the
     standard antibiotic. This infection is called
     Methicillin-Resistant-Staphylococcus Aureus. This type of infection can
     be life-threatening especially during the first three to four days of
     admission. In the case when this information is stored in the PDPA of the
     present invention, the next episode of infection can be dealt with
     swiftly by the appropriate initial therapy being gear toward MRSA while
     waiting for the culture result.
<BR><BR>[0045]In an inpatient setting, the PDPA may be implemented to interface
     with automated blood pressure machines, cardiac monitors in Critical Care
     Units (CCU) or Intensive Care Units (ICU), ventilators, automated
     glucometers, automated Intravenous (IV) drip machines, and virtually any
     other medical machine or device. The PDPA may also be readily implemented
     and programmed to interface with hospital or clinic electronic patient
     records.
<BR><BR>[0046]In one particular embodiment, in the scenario of neprhotoxic IV
     antibiotics, the PDPA keeps tract (via lab test interface) of the peak
     and trough serum levels of the drug and warns the pharmacist to readjust
     the dose or the rate of the IV drip.
<BR><BR>[0047]According to another specific application, in the case of a blood
     transfusion, the PDPA is implemented to verify that the blood unit
     assigned to patient is correct.
<BR><BR>[0048]In accordance with yet another specific embodiment hereof, during an
     organ transplant the PDPA is implemented to track the matching donor
     organ to the patient. Patients' blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate,
     temperature, and an assessment of the 5th vital sign (pain scale) are
     then monitored by the PDPA during the surgical procedure.
<BR><BR>[0049]Given the dynamic adaptable platform provided by the present PDPA,
     it may be readily and easily implemented, configured, or programmed to
     perform a wide variety of capabilities and functions. These include, for
     example, monitoring and verifying additional past treatments and
     prescriptions; tracking and monitoring drug or medical allergenic agents;
     performing a thermometer function to check patient temperature;
     maintaining a drug library and side-effects index including updated lists
     of active drugs and discontinued drugs (with starting date, disuse date,
     and comments on the reason for discontinuation); providing the capability
     to cross check the drug library for adverse reactions; and providing a
     real time clock to remind patients to take prescribed medicines at the
     right time or at proper intervals.
<BR><BR>[0050]More specifically, the PDPA of the present invention is directed to
     a portable patient assistant device. This device in one particular
     embodiment includes an RFID reader implemented to read an RFID tag
     associated with patient use of medicinal drugs, a central processing unit
     for processing signals received from the RFID reader, a memory for
     storing data about the medicinal drugs, the memory being operatively
     associated with the central processing unit, and an output operatively
     linked to the central processing unit to provide output information
     regarding the use of medicinal drugs. In this embodiment, the output may
     be advantageously linked to a computer system so that the output
     information is communicated to a remote location. Here the link to the
     computer system may be preferably implemented by hard wire, wirelessly,
     or both by hard wire and wirelessly.
<BR><BR>[0051]In accordance with yet another aspect of this invention, the central
     processing unit may advantageously include a logic processor and a
     controller, and further the stored data may include proper use data
     regarding administration of the medicinal drugs. Thus here in this
     particular implementation, when the logic processor determines
     non-conforming drug use by the patient, the controller directs a distress
     signal to the output for transmission to a predetermined remote location.
<BR><BR>[0052]According to a related aspect hereof, the stored data may include
     data regarding manufacturing aspects of the medicinal drugs. Thus
     similarly here in this related particularized implementation, when the
     logic processor determines non-conforming manufacturing aspects of the
     medicinal drugs during patient use, the controller directs a signal to
     the output to advise the patient to discontinue use activity. And
     according to a related aspect thereto, the device may be preferably
     implement in a manner such that when the logic processor verifies
     conforming manufacturing aspects of the medicinal drugs during patient
     use, the controller directs a signal to the output to advise the patient
     to continue use activity.
<BR><BR>[0053]In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention there
     is further provided a system for facilitating patient doctor interaction
     during patient care. This system includes (1) a portable patient
     assistant device including a central processing unit, a memory for
     storing data operatively associated with the central processing unit, and
     an output operatively linked to the central processing unit to provide
     output information to the patient; (2) a medical computer under control
     of the doctor, the medical computer having a central processing unit, a
     memory, and at least one communication link to a remote location for
     retrieving information relating to the patient care; and (3) means for
     transferring information from the medical computer to the portable
     patient assistant device so that when the patient uses the portable
     patient assistant device in the absence of attending medical personnel,
     the output provides relevant care information to the patient. In this
     embodiment, the at least one communication link may advantageously
     include a connection to any one or more of the Internet, a secure medical
     LAN, an insurance company, and a pharmacy. According to another aspect
     hereof, the portable patient assistant device may further include an RFID
     reader implemented to read an RFID tag associated with patient use of
     medicinal drugs. In this case, the central processing unit of the
     portable patient assistant device is enabled to process signals received
     from the RFID reader so that the output provides information regarding
     the use of medicinal drugs. Here the means for transferring information
     from the medical computer to the portable patient assistant device may
     include a docking station, wireless data transfer, or both.
<BR><BR>[0054]In accordance with still yet another aspect of this invention there
     is also provided a method for facilitating a patient's visit to a medical
     or dental office. This method includes the steps of (1) arriving at an
     office appointment with a portable patient assistant device including a
     memory having stored patient data, an input for receiving data into the
     device, and an output for outputting information from the device to a
     remote location; (2) connecting the portable patient assistant device to
     an office computer system; (3) transferring at least some of the stored
     patient data from the memory to the office computer system; (4) inputting
     updated patient data into the office computer system; and (5)
     transferring the updated patient data from the office computer system to
     the portable patient assistant device for patient use after completion of
     the office appointment.
<BR><BR>[0055]In an alternate embodiment thereof, the method may include the steps
     of (1) arriving at an office appointment with a portable patient
     assistant device including a memory having stored patient data, an input
     for receiving data into the device, and an output for outputting
     information from the device to a remote location; (2) connecting the
     portable patient assistant device to an office computer system; (3)
     connecting the office computer system to an insurance company computer
     system; (4) transferring at least some of the stored patient data from
     the memory to the office computer system; (5) transferring at least some
     of the transferred patient data from the office computer system to the
     insurance company computer system; (6) inputting updated patient data
     into the office computer system; and (7) transferring the updated patient
     data from the office computer system to the portable patient assistant
     device for patient use after completion of the office appointment. This
     method may advantageously further include the step of receiving updated
     insurance data from the insurance company computer system. And in this
     case, the method in certain embodiments hereof may include the further
     step of storing the updated insurance data from the insurance company
     computer system in the office computer system. Alternatively, the further
     step of storing the updated insurance data from the insurance company
     computer system in the portable patient assistant device may be utilized.
     And thereafter when desired, the method may still also include the
     further step of transferring the updated insurance data from the office
     computer system into the portable patient assistant device.
<BR><BR>[0056]According to still yet another and further embodiment of this
     principal aspect of the present invention there is also provided a method
     for providing insurance company review and dispatch of a patient expense.
     This method includes the steps of (1) providing a patient with a portable
     patient assistant device including a memory for storing patient data, an
     input for receiving data into the device, and an output for outputting
     information from the device to a remote location; (2) inputting a
     procedure request into the memory of the portable patient assistant
     device; (3) connecting the portable patient assistant device to an
     insurance company computer system; (4) reviewing the procedure request at
     the insurance company; and (5) providing a result from the reviewing
     step. This method may be implemented so that the step of providing a
     result includes any one of a denial of the procedure request, an approval
     of the procedure request, or a follow-up request for more information.
<BR><BR>[0057]Any one of the above embodiments may advantageously further include
     the additional step of transferring the result from the insurance company
     computer system to the portable patient assistant device. In any case
     thereof, the inputting step is preferably performed by authorized medical
     personnel from a doctor's office. Here in certain specific embodiments
     the method may further include the steps of connecting the portable
     patient assistant device to a doctor's office medical computer and
     transferring the result from the insurance company computer system to the
     doctor's office medical computer.
<BR><BR>[0058]Alternatively the inputting step is performed by authorized dental
     personnel from a dentist's office and may further include the steps of
     connecting the portable patient assistant device to a dentist's office
     medical computer and transferring the result from the insurance company
     computer system to the dentist's office medical computer.
<BR><BR>[0059]According to another aspect of the present invention there is
     further provided a method of creating a life-time medical history for an
     individual. This method includes the steps of obtaining a portable
     patient assistant device at the time of birth of an individual where the
     portable patient assistant device includes a memory; storing in the
     memory of the portable patient assistant device personal information and
     medical information relating to the birth of the individual to thereby
     create a birth record; and ensuring that the portable patient assistant
     device accompanies the individual to each medical office visit after
     birth so that the birth record may be supplemented with updated medical
     information. While the individual is a child, the parents may preferably
     perform the steps of this method on behalf of their child. When the child
     reaches an age of maturity where he or she starts visiting doctors,
     hospitals, dentists, pharmacies, and other medical offices or facilities
     on his or her own account, or without parental accompaniment, the
     portable patient assistant device may then be transferred to the custody
     and care of the adult child for continued use throughout life. In this
     manner, a complete medical record from the time of birth is created and
     made readily available for continued use as needed by the parent during
     childhood, and then by the independent child after maturity.
<BR><BR>[0060]This aspect of the present invention is further directed to a system
     for dispatching information during a medical emergency. One embodiment of
     this system advantageously includes (i) a portable digital patient
     assistant for use by a patient during an ambulance ride to a hospital

     presented in FIGS. 1 and 2A. FIG. 2B shows the "wrist band"
     implementation of the present PDPA 104. The general configuration of this
     embodiment is that of a typical wrist watch. Notwithstanding its smaller
     size, this embodiment of the present PDPA 104 may include any and all of
     the same features and functionalities as associated with the waist-belt
     type illustrated in FIG. 2A.
<BR><BR>[0130]With reference next to FIG. 2C, there is shown a simplified block
     diagram of the principal features and components of the portable digital
     patient assistant 104 according to this invention represented in
     combination with different interactive computer systems and various RFID
     readers for illustrative purposes. The PDPA 104 preferably includes an
     RFID reader 116, a logic processor or central processing unit (CPU) 118,
     a controller or microcontroller 120, a memory 122, flash memory 124,
     input functions 126, output functions 128, and an RFID tag 129. The RFID
     tag 129 associated with the PDPA 104 must first be initialized so they it
     may then permanently store the patient's unique ID. In this manner, as
     the patient carries his PDPA to various locations different RFID readers
     may readily identify the patient as further described below.
<BR><BR>[0131]As would be readily understood by one of skill in the relevant art
     of circuit design and IC manufacturing, the logic processor or central
     processing unit (CPU) 118, the controller or microcontroller 120, the
     memory 122, and the flash memory 124 may be implemented in a wide variety
     of different IC packages and assemblies. These may include standard chip
     sets containing individual chips for each of these principal functions
     such as, for example, the 7400 series (from Texas Instruments) and/or the
     4000 series (originally from RCA and thereafter ported to Texas
     Instruments 74HC/74HCT series) of Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL)
     integrated circuits which include logic building blocks that can be wired
     together for use in many different applications. Alternatively or in
     combination with some standard chips, the required features and functions
     of the present portable digital patient assistant may be implemented in
     one or more Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designed and
     particularized for a specific embodiment hereof. Currently available
     ASICs may include over 100 million gates. These often include entire
     32-bit processors, memory blocks including ROM, RAM, EEPROM, Flash, and
     other large building blocks. Such a fully loaded and inter-operative ASIC
     is often termed a SoC (System-on-a-Chip). As an intermediate option
     between standard chips on the one hand and highly customized ASICs on the
     other, some or virtually all of the electronic components of the present
     portable digital patient assistant may alternatively be implemented alone
     or in combination with ASICs and standard chips by use of one or more
     Application Specific Standard Products (ASSPs) which include an
     integrated circuit that implements at least one specific function that
     comports with a broadly adopted platform. Examples thereof include the
     known ASSPs that perform video and/or audio encoding and/or decoding.
<BR><BR>[0132]As illustrated further in FIG. 2C, output 128 may include audio
     and/or video outputs and input 126 may be implemented by audio and/or by
     key pad or push button. Each of these components, functions, and aspects
     of the PDPA 104 will be described in further detail herein below. As
     further illustrated in FIG. 2C, the RFID reader 116 is employed to read
     an RFID tag 130 which according to certain aspects hereof may be
     contained within a medicinal tablet or a drug container as herein later
     described in further detail. In certain preferred embodiments hereof, the
     RFID reader 116 has at least a 2 foot range and is capable of reaching an
     RFID tag in a patient's stomach, for example. FIG. 2C also shows a
     generalized external RFID reader 131 to represent that the PDPA RFID tag
     129 may be read by any enabled reader at any location when the PDPA 104
     is in sufficient proximity of the external reader 131.
<BR><BR>[0133]The PDPA 104 may be advantageously connected wirelessly and/or by
     hard-wire to any number of different computer systems and/or networks to
     thereby achieve further aspects and functions of the present invention.
     Such computer systems include, for example, a home computer 132 (either
     desk top or laptop), a work computer 134, an ambulance computer or other
     emergency vehicle computer 136 including an in-vehicle RFID reader 137, a
     hospital computer 138 including an on-site RFID reader 139, a doctor's
     office computer 140 including an in-office RFID reader 141, or a pharmacy
     computer 142 including an in-store RFID reader 143 as illustrated. Thus
     according to one aspect of the present invention, it is intended that the
     patient carry his PDPA on his person while in daily activity. In this
     way, when the patient enters the pharmacy, the doctor's office, the
     hospital, or requires transportation in an ambulance, the RFID readers
     maintained in these locations according to the teachings hereof may
     quickly and automatically uniquely identify the patient by his personal
     RFID as broadcast by the PDPA RFID tag 129 when in sufficient proximity
     to any of the illustrated readers.
<BR><BR>[0134]Any one of these computer systems represented in FIG. 2C may be
     inter-operatively linked with the portable digital patient assistant 104
     by way of a hard wire connection such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB)
     connection represented by solid line in FIG. 2C. Either in the
     alternative or also combined with hard-wire capability, this
     inter-operative communications link may be made by any suitable wireless
     connection as represented by a receiver/transmitter pair 144, 146
     illustrated by way of example between the ambulance computer 136 and the
     PDPA 104. Such wireless links include, for example, Local Area Networks
     (LANs), Bluetooth (a U.S. registered certification mark in the name of
     BLUETOOTH SIG, INC. of Delaware) for wireless Personal Area Networks
     (PANs), and any other suitable current or future wireless protocol.
     Depending on the particular embodiment hereof which may be implemented to
     correspond to a particularized application or need, the inter-operative
     communications link between the PDPA 104 and its associated computer
     system, whether wireless or hard wire, may be either one-way or two-way.
     In this manner, larger data files may be downloaded, uploaded, and
     exchanged between these computer systems and the PDPA.
<BR><BR>[0135]With reference now to FIG. 3A, there is shown the patient 102
     wearing the PDPA 104 in the doctor's office 106. As employed in the
     doctor's office 106, the medical computer 140 includes a docking station
     148 that is adapted to receive the PDPA 104, as illustrated, so that the
     PDPA may be synchronized with data received from the doctor's medical
     computer 140. In addition thereto, the medical computer 140 may
     advantageously include the reader 141 so that as the patient enters the
     office, his ID is automatically sent to the office computer system. As an
     alternative to docking station 148, the PDPA may be updated by wireless
     connection with the medical computer 140. During a typical visit by a
     patient employing the present PDPA to a doctor's office that has adopted
     a compatible inter-active system of the type disclosed herein, the
     medical computer 140 sends (uploads) a password protected encrypted
     diagnosis, treatment, and prescription data to the PDPA 104. The doctor's
     medical computer 140 then synchronizes data on both the computer 140 and
     PDPA 104. This data may include all doctors' information such as patient
     history, insurance, and billing information as well as emergency contact
     information. According to one aspect of the present PDPA as employed in
     conjunction with a doctor's visit, the physician may instruct the patient
     regarding the taking of medications as prescribed, keeping tract of blood
     sugar level on a diabetic diet, and keeping tract of blood pressure while
     on medications. According to this aspect, the PDPA is utilized by the
     physician to aid the patient in following the patient's medication,
     self-care, and diet compliance. Here during the visit, the doctor uploads
     the fingerstick blood sugar from the patient's glucometer or the blood
     pressure measured from the patient's automated blood pressure cuff (for
     drug and diet compliance), programs instructions and reminders for the
     patient that will be periodically delivered to the patient during
     continuous PADA use at home and work, reminders for follow-up testing to
     be conducted including locations, telephone numbers and driving
     directions, and schedules a time for a next visit. The PDPA can also be
     used to remind the patient to go to the lab for blood tests a few days
     prior to his next visit with the doctor. And in a similar manner, it can
     also be programmed by the patient or doctor to help remind of the date
     for a follow up visit.
<BR><BR>[0136]As also shown in FIG. 3A, the doctor's office medical computer 140
     may be advantageously linked to the Internet, a secure medical LAN which
     may provide communication to the hospital computer system 138 (FIG. 2C),
     the insurance company of the patient, and to local pharmacies. Thus in
     this manner, the doctor's medicinal computer 140 may be updated with a
     wide variety of relevant information so that such information may then be
     transferred to the patient's PDPA under strict doctor supervision. As the
     current generation of children, teenagers, and adults become ever more
     familiar with computers, PDAs, on-line activities, and related electronic
     apparatus and methods for receiving, processing, and distributing
     information; the inventors hereof believe that both current and future
     generations of patients, doctors, and medical staff will adopt the
     devices, methods, and systems disclosed herein with great ease and
     acceptability such that use of all the different inventive aspects hereof
     become to us all as second nature as making a telephone call.
<BR><BR>[0137]Next in FIG. 3B there is shown a flow chart of one particular
     representative method employed in conjunction with use of the present
     portable digital patient assistant during a patient visit to the doctor's
     office. This method begins with a start step 150 when the patient arrives
     at the doctor's office. Upon arrival, the patient hands his PDPA to the
     office receptionist, nurse, doctor, or other authorized office personnel.
     This step is analogous to the current prior art practice where at the
     doctor or dentist office, pen and paper are used to sign-in with a date,
     time of arrival, time of appointment, home phone number, and whether the
     visiting patient's insurance coverage has changed since the last visit.
     In the current prior art practice where the visiting patient is a new
     patient to that office, typically a large number of forms need to be
     filled out manually by method of pen and paper. As is also typical in
     this situation, the new patient upon arrival may not have ready access to
     all the kinds of information requested in the paper forms. Thus the
     patient here may need to make several telephone calls from the doctor's
     office to a spouse or parent, for example, to get information such as
     social security number of the primary insured, policy numbers, telephone
     numbers for non-family emergency contacts, and other similar information
     ordinarily required from new patients at their first visit to a new
     doctor's or dentist's office. This task can take anywhere from 10 minutes
     to a half hour and may be difficult for a new visiting patient who is
     either very sick or injured. At other times in this situation, some of
     the needed information may simply be left blank since the new patient may
     not be able to complete the form on the spot from memory. Also they may
     not have carried with them to the office any reference papers they could
     use to obtain the needed information or otherwise may not be able to make
     telephone calls or reach loved ones who may have access to the
     information at distant locations. The visiting new patient and the
     returning patient both also need to always carry their insurance card in
     the typical situation. If they do not, delays in registration or service
     may occur and follow-up administrative activities may become necessary
     using time and resources that in the case where the patient brought his
     insurance card in the first instance, such time-consuming follow-up
     administrative activities would not have been required. Thus according to
     this aspect of the present invention, all of the above information is
     stored (and continuously updated) in the visiting patient's PDPA and this
     applies whether he is a new patient to a particular doctor's or dentist's
     office or a previously registered well known returning patient. As
     briefly indicated above, in practice according to the various aspects of
     this invention, the present PDPA is continuously and/or periodically
     updated at a wide variety of different touch points in the daily use
     process. Firstly, the patient can update his PDPA on an ongoing basis by
     inputting information himself either manually, by docking it in his home
     docking station and then downloading information from secured or
     non-secured websites such as the doctor's, hospital's, or insurance
     company's websites. The PDPA may also be automatically updated by
     wirelessly connecting to any LAN or PAN, or otherwise docking his PDPA on
     his home docking station actively overnight, for example, for off-hours
     batch processing, polling, and updating with either personal information,
     medical information, appointment scheduling, changes in scheduling,
     medical news, or software updates from the authorized manufacture of the
     PDPA. The PDPA may also be updated during any time it is connected,
     either by hard wire or wirelessly, to any of the computer systems
     represented in FIG. 2C. Thus in start step 150 when the patient arrives
     at the doctor's office and hands his PDPA to the office receptionist,
     nurse, doctor, or other authorized office personnel, that person then
     links the patient's PDPA to the office medical computer system. Once this
     link is made, any of the above discussed updates may be performed
     according to the following illustrative method or, alternatively, in
     accordance with any desired variations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0138]In the next step of the method shown in FIG. 3B, server-detected
     step 152, the patient's PDPA then performs a processing task to determine
     whether a relevant medical server has been detected. Once step 152 is
     completed and a link between the PDPA and medical server is initiated, a
     security-check step 154 is performed. This security check may include a
     hand-shake between the PDPA RFID tag and the doctor's office RFID reader
     141 as shown in FIG. 3A. In the case where the security-check step 154
     has failed, then the security problem is addressed at a
     correct-security-problem step 156. The security check subroutine here is
     discussed below in further detail with reference to FIG. 3C. In the case
     where the security-check step 154 is positive or confirmed as "OK", then
     the method proceeds to the next step which is a confirm-appointment step
     158. Here at confirm-appointment step 158, the patient ID is sent to the
     insurance company to, inter alia, prevent insurance fraud. Thus according
     to this aspect of the present invention, the doctor's office medical
     computer 140 accesses the insurance company's data base as illustrated in
     FIG. 3A. Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 3B, an upload-data step 160 is next
     performed in the illustrated method. This upload may be performed by
     either a suitable wireless connection or by a hard-wire connection such
     as USB, for example. Here as needed, any required information from the
     insurance company's data base is accessed by the doctor's in-office
     medical computer before being uploaded to the patient's PDPA. Next
     performed is an update-insurance-information step 162. Here at step 162,
     information may be exchanged both from the patient's PDPA, to the
     doctor's medical computer, and then to the insurance company's computer
     system and data base for an update from the patient to his insurance
     company as well as the reverse route thereof being from the insurance
     company's computer system, to the doctor's medical computer, and then to
     the patient's PDPA. The updated information from the patient PDPA to both
     the doctor and insurance company may include, for example, change of home
     or work address, change of email address or telephone contact numbers,
     change in marital status, birth of a new child, passing of a birthday so
     as to increase recorded age by one year, and any other required,
     relevant, necessary, or desired personal or medical information. The
     updated information from the insurance company via the doctor's medical
     computer (which may be stored thereon as well) to the patient PDPA may
     include, for example, a recalculation of a relevant insurance deductible,
     insurance company approval for payment or reimbursement of a requested
     procedure, and such others as needed or desired for a particular
     application.
<BR><BR>[0139]After the update-insurance-information step 162 is complete, the
     method shown in FIG. 3B proceeds to a new-health-problem step 164 to
     determine whether the current visit is for a new health problem or a
     recurring health problem. In the case where the visit is for a new health
     problem, the illustrated process next proceeds to an is-visit-finished
     step 166. At this point either the doctor, patient, or an authorized
     person from the doctor's medical staff then preferably engage with the
     input of the PDPA and then answer this inquiry accordingly. In the case
     where the answer to the is-visit-finished step 166 is a "yes", the
     illustrated method then finally proceeds to a write-to-memory step 168.
     Here the doctor's medical computer then updates the patient's PDPA with
     any and all needed updates such as the diagnosis and additional medical
     information including, for example, past visits, newly prescribed drug
     prescriptions, tests results, tests to be performed, x-ray images, CAT
     scan results, MRI images, and any additional information that may be
     required, relevant, or desired. It should be understood here that during
     the patient's visit the doctor and his staff have been inputting
     information into the doctor's office medical computer and/or receiving
     additional relevant patient information for remote locations via network
     connection. The official doctor's office patient file is this updated in
     this manner. Now at write-to-memory step 168, the doctor's office medical
     computer is programmed to determine what part, if not all of this updated
     file information, is to be written to the patient's PDPA.
<BR><BR>[0140]In the case where the answer to the is-visit-finished step 166 is a
     "no", the illustrated method then loops back to the new-health-problem
     step 164 to determine whether there are any additional new health
     problems or any additional recurring health problems. In the case where
     the answer to the new-health-problem step 164 is a "no" thereby
     indicating that the visit is for at least one recurring health problem,
     the illustrated method proceeds to a more-than-three-times step 170. Here
     the PDPA checks its memory to determine whether the specific health
     problem then under consideration has occurred, for example, more than
     three times in the proceeding year. In the case where a certain minimum
     threshold for reoccurrence within the set fixed time, here a year, is
     detected, the PDPA then give a message to either or both the doctor and
     the patient to consider the problem more closely or obtain a second
     opinion as indicated by a consult-and-consider step 172. In the case
     where the answer to the more-than-three-times step 170 is a "no", the
     illustrated method then continues to steps 166 and 168 as described
     above. Also after consult-and-consider step 172 is completed, this
     embodiment then continues to steps 166 and 168 as shown and described
     above. Thus the method according to this embodiment includes the further
     step of determining whether the patient's visit is for a new health
     problem or a reoccurring health problem. And in accordance therewith,
     when the patient's visit is for the reoccurring health problem, the
     portable patient assistant device determines whether visits for the
     reoccurring health problem have exceeded a predetermined number within a
     predetermined time period. And then in further accordance therewith, when
     the visits for the reoccurring health problem have exceeded the
     predetermined number within the predetermined time period, the portable
     patient assistant device provides a prompt to obtain a second opinion.
<BR><BR>[0141]The PDPA of the present invention is intended to carry personal and
     private medical information much of which is confidential and/or private
     in nature. Thus the inventors hereof have provided device security for
     the PDPA so that the personal, private, and confidential information
     contained therein is duly protected from unauthorized disclosure.
     Security in the present PDPA is organized in 4 different levels. At Level
     1, no password is required. Stand by, when unit is first turned on. It
     will display patient's name, contact phone number and "if found return
     address". Emergency override contact phone number in the event of
     emergency when the patient is incapacitated or unconscious. At Level 2,
     password access is required. Here personal and insurance information
     access is used for application such as making doctor appointment,
     pharmacy and other institutions alike. It is a two way link: upload data
     and download when finished. Level 3, additional password access is
     required. Data as level 2 plus medical records is for doctor diagnosis.
     It is also 2 way link as above. Here in some cases, a patient's doctor
     may have access to stored patient records that the patient himself does
     not have access to such as in the case of minors or mentally impaired.
     The Level 4 includes a password for full access. This security level
     gives medical care givers full access: personal, insurance, medical
     records and all tests results. It covers access as above 3 levels and
     beyond.
<BR><BR>[0142]At each contact point such as doctor's office, insurance office, or
     pharmacy, a built in <B><I>security protocol</I></B> in the PDPA will establish
     password and access level and capture its computer RF or LAN
     communication ID and store in file similar to COOKIES in Internet web
     browser. With this setup, when the patient approaches any of the above
     offices, its computer and PDPA will ask each other for authorization.
     Once a correct password is received, the data will be transferred in the
     manner as per pre-arrangement. A birth date may be used for crossed check
     medicine. Example: Adult medicine is wrongfully subscribed to pediatric
     patient. Another example is using adult medicine proportionally to the
     pediatric patient age. Another example is to flag attention to the doctor
     for age related diseases such as colon cancer, suggesting the patient
     have a colonoscopy; or suggesting preventive treatment for Alzheimer when
     the patient reaches sixties (at 65 years of age, one in ten American will
     have the disease, at 85 years of age, the odds are one in two).
<BR><BR>[0143]Insurance information is used to streamline the insurance paperwork
     process as well as for accurate payment and to prevent insurance fraud.
     It is also used to detect non-approved medical procedures or medicines.
<BR><BR>[0144]FIG. 3C is a flow chart of one particular representative
     security-check subroutine that may be utilized in the doctor's office
     visit method discussed above in conjunction with FIG. 3B. This method
     starts with a power-up-self-test 206. Here when the PDPA is turned-on, a
     diagnostic self-test is run to ensure the system is functioning properly.
     The next step is a server-detected step 208. Here if no server is
     detected the system remains on stand-by mode waiting to detect a
     recognized server or an RFID tag. On the other hand when a recognized
     server is detected, the method proceeds to a security-present step 210.
     In the event no pre-arranged security is present, the method directs the
     user to a set-up-security step 212. In the case where a pre-arranged
     security is present, the method then directs the user to a
     check-ID-and-initiate step 214. Thereafter the method proceeds to a
     password-issued-and-correct step 216. If a password has not yet been
     issued or is incorrect, the method then directs the user to a
     first-time-password-setup step 218. Here at step 218 the user password is
     either setup for the first time, corrected, or changed if expired. The
     system then loops back to the check-ID-and-initiate step 214 and then
     next again to the password-issued-and-correct step 216. When the password
     is correct, the method proceeds to a confirm-appointment-with-server step
     220, then to an allow-data-transfer step 222, and next to a
     visit-finished step 224. If the visit has not finished at that time, the
     method loops back to the confirm-appointment-with-server step 220 to
     check what additional in-office x-rays, consultations, or other medical
     services may still be required during the current visit. Once the current
     doctor's office visit is finished, the method proceeds to a
     close-record-and-update-data step 226. Here after the visit is finished
     and all medical services are rendered or completed, the method closes the
     record for that visit and updates data in both the doctor office computer
     system and the PDPA.
<BR><BR>[0145]As the current generation of children, teenagers, and adults become
     ever more familiar with computers, PDAs, on-line activities, and related
     electronic apparatus and methods for receiving, processing, and
     distributing information; the inventors hereof believe that both current
     and future generations of patients, doctors, and medical staff will adopt
     the devices, methods, and systems disclosed herein with great ease and
     acceptability such that use of all the different inventive aspects hereof
     become to us as second nature as riding a bike, making a telephone call,
     or driving a car. In addition thereto, it should be readily understood by
     those of skill in the relevant arts that the devices, methods, and
     systems disclosed herein may be easily adapted to other environments such
     as, for example, for dental services where a dental patient is visiting a
     dentist's office for routine or emergency dental work. Thus the present
     PDPA may be employed according to the teachings hereof for both medical
     and dental health and care purposes.
<BR><BR>[0146]Now continuing with reference next to FIG. 4A, there is shown the
     patient 102 wearing the PDPA 104 at the pharmacy 108. The patient may
     have just completed a visit to the doctor's office or dentist's office as
     described above. His PDPA is thus current with updated information
     including any recently prescribed drug prescriptions. Upon arrival at the
     pharmacy desk, the patient hands his PDPA to the attending pharmacy
     personnel who may be a pharmacist 174 as illustrated or an authorized
     staff member. In this manner, the patient need not carry his insurance
     card or paper prescription. The pharmacist then docks the PDPA into the
     pharmacy computer docking station 148 in a similar manner as described
     above in reference to the doctor's office visit. As employed in the
     pharmacy 108, the pharmacy computer 142 then uploads any password
     protected prescription from the PDPA 104, and the prescription is then
     filled according to further aspects discussed below. As in the case at
     the doctor's office visit, here when the patient enters the proximity of
     the pharmacy RFID reader 143, there may be provided to the pharmacy
     computer 142 the patient's ID before the docking operation for
     downloading larger files.
<BR><BR>[0147]As also shown in FIG. 4A, the pharmacy computer 142 may be
     advantageously linked to the Internet, a secure medical LAN which may
     provide communication to the hospital computer system 138 (FIG. 2C), the
     insurance company of the patient, and to the patient's doctors. Thus in
     this manner, the pharmacy computer 142 may be updated with a wide variety
     of relevant information so that such information may then be transferred
     to the patient's PDPA as needed. In addition thereto, the pharmacy
     computer 142 may verify information received from the patient PDPA by
     accessing any one of these linked remote computer systems.
<BR><BR>[0148]For a patient who has multiple doctors, the pharmacist and the
     pharmacy computer 142 can keep tract of the medications the patient is
     taking to avoid redundancy, toxicity, and lethal interactions. More
     particularly, the patient can go to different doctors attending to
     different kinds of illness and might then mistakenly be prescribed
     multiple prescriptions of the same type of drugs; for example, Oxycontin
     by doctor A, Vicodin by doctor B, and codeine by doctor C. Recently in
     California, there is an example of a patient's death because he combined
     many narcotics given by his doctors. To cite another danger, when a
     patient is on a blood thinner, Warfarin for example, and he is not
     supposed to take any drugs that can cause prolongation of Coumadin
     activity to thereby reduce the high risk of hemorrhage/bleeding. Thus
     with the PDPA and related methods, the pharmacist for either an inpatient
     or outpatient can keep tract of all medications the patient is taking to
     avoid redundancy, to prevent the increased risk for toxicity or adverse
     reactions, and to most importantly avoid lethal drug interactions.
<BR><BR>[0149]Thus according to further embodiments of the methods herein
     disclosed and claimed, the inputting step of the method for providing
     insurance company review and processing of a patient expense may be
     alternatively performed by authorized personnel from a pharmacy during a
     patient visit for purchasing a prescribed medication. This embodiment may
     then include the further step of transferring the result from the
     insurance company computer system to the portable patient assistant
     device, and/or the further step of transferring the result from the
     insurance company computer system to the pharmacy computer 142.
<BR><BR>[0150]As further illustrated in FIG. 4A, containers 176 used by the
     pharmacy may include an RFID tag 130 according to additional aspects
     hereof. Next turning to FIG. 4B, there is shown a partial pictorial and
     block diagram representation of the portable digital patient assistant
     104 reading RFID tags 130 at the pharmacy. As illustrated, the PDPA 104
     includes the RFID reader 116, the processor 118, the controller 120, the
     memory 122, the flash memory 124, the input functions 126, the output
     functions 128, and the PDPA RFID tag 129. The PDPA 104 is illustrated
     connected to the pharmacy computer 142 by both hard wire and the wireless
     receiver/transmitter pair 144, 146 and, as discussed above, either or
     both of these connections may be utilized depending on need,
     applicability, and preference. FIG. 4B also illustrates the medicine
     container 176 including a single RFID tag 130 shown on the cap thereof.
     The container 176 is shown partially filled with a number of medicine
     tablets 178 each also including a respective RFID tag 130. These tablets
     may be either of a pill-type or the capsule type as shown. According to
     additional device implementations, systems, and methods relating hereto,
     while purchasing medication at the pharmacy the PDPA 104 is engaged to
     read the RFID tag 130 on the container 176 and store an identification
     number associated with that specific container in the memory 122. In
     further embodiments hereof, the PDPA may also be enabled to read each
     RFID tag 130 in each and every tablet 178 in the container 176. Similarly
     here, each tablet 178 has an individual identification by virtue of its
     embedded RFID tag. In this embodiment then, each and every of these
     individual tablet identification numbers are also stored in the memory
     122 of the PDPA 104. Alternatively, the pharmacy computer 142 when
     equipped with the RFID reader 143 as illustrated may be employed such
     that upon purchase the pharmacy computer 142 and reader 143 perform the
     initial reading and processing of the RFID tags of the container 176 and
     tablets 178 while subsequent readings during home use of the medication
     are performed by the RFID reader 116 in the patient PDPA 104. In this
     case, the identification numbers are first recorded in the pharmacy
     computer 142 and then transferred to the patient's PDPA at the point of
     sale. Thus in this manner after the patient leaves the pharmacy and then
     administers the medication at home, the PDPA may make a record of each
     time the container is used as well as, for example, when and how many
     tablets 178 are administered or taken by the patient. Thus according to
     further aspects hereof, when the number of tablets drops below a minimum
     number, the output 128 of the PDPA may be activated to send a refill
     order to the pharmacy. In addition thereto, the pharmacy computer 142 may
     be connected to the doctor office computer 140 as shown so that the
     refill order is also sent to the doctor's attention. The doctor may then
     approve the refill order, modify the order, prescribe new medication or
     different doses, and/or call the patient or schedule a follow-up visit
     for further examination, tests, or consultation. As indicated above, the
     links between these computer systems may be by hard wire or wireless
     connections and the PDPA may communicate directly with these systems or
     by first being connected to the patient's home computer as discussed
     above.
<BR><BR>[0151]Thus in view of the disclosure presented above, with particular
     regard to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the present invention in certain particular
     embodiments relating to this principal aspect is directed to a system for
     monitoring a patient's purchase and use of medication. This system may
     include system (1) a pharmacy computer system 142 including a database
     having patient information; (2) a container 176 including an RFID
     container tag 130 that provides the container with a particular container
     identification number, the RFID container tag capable of emitting a
     signal including the container identification number; (3) a plurality of
     medicinal tablets 178 stored in the container 176, each of the medicinal
     tablets 178 including an RFID tablet tag 130 that provides a
     corresponding respective tablet with a particular tablet identification
     number, each of the RFID tablet tags 130 capable of emitting a signal
     including its respective tablet identification number; and (4) a portable
     digital patient assistant 104 for use by the patient during purchase and
     administration of the medicinal tablets, the portable digital patient
     assistant 104 being connectable to the pharmacy computer system 142 and
     including a memory 122 and an RFID reader 116 capable of detecting the
     signals emitted by the respective RFID tags 130 so that upon purchase,
     the RFID reader 116 detects the RFID tags 130 and the portable digital
     patient assistant 104 stores the particular container and tablet
     identification numbers in the memory 122 and transfers same to the
     pharmacy computer system 142 for storing in the database thereof. In this
     embodiment, the portable digital patient assistant 104 may further
     include the processor 118 operatively linked with the RFID reader 116,
     the processor 118 enabled to determine a count of medicinal tablets 178.
<BR><BR>[0152]According to another aspect of this embodiment, during patient use
     of medication the RFID reader 116 detects the RFID container and tablet
     tags 130 in a subsequent reading and the processor 118 compares the
     container and tablet identification numbers from the subsequent reading
     with those obtained at the time of purchase to thereby determine a count
     of remaining tablets. In this manner, the processor 118 determines a
     count of medicinal tablets and whether the number of counted medicinal
     tablets is still stored within the container by analyzing the signals
     returned from the RFID container and tablet tags 130 during patient use
     thereof. In addition thereto, the processor 118 may be advantageously
     implemented to determine a count of medicinal tablets 178 and whether the
     number of counted medicinal tablets have been ingested by the patient by
     analyzing the signals returned from the RFID tablet tags relative to any
     signal returned from the RFID container tag. In this specific embodiment,
     the PDPA 104 may further include a communications output 128 and a
     controller 120 operatively linked with the processor 118, the controller
     120 enabled to activate the communications output 128 in a predetermined
     manner. Here as further implemented, when the count of medicinal tablets
     in the container 176 drops below a set threshold, the controller 120
     activates the communications output 128 to send a refill order to the
     pharmacy computer system 142. And in a further implementation hereof, the
     system further includes the doctor office computer system 140 operatively
     linked to the pharmacy computer system 142 so that when the pharmacy
     computer system 142 receives the refill order the doctor office computer
     system 140 is notified thereof. Thus from a remote location, the portable
     digital patient assistant may be periodically linked to the doctor office
     computer system to update same with patient information and, more
     particularly with patient information regarding the patient's use of
     medication.
<BR><BR>[0153]The inventors hereof understand that acceptance and implementation
     of all the related and inter-related devices, systems, and methods
     disclosed herein will require sometime. Thus as these are being accepted
     and phased-in for wide use according to the entirety hereof, the
     inventors further provide, for initial implementation and then for
     continued and expanded use thereafter, a system for monitoring a
     pharmacy's sales and distribution of medication as illustrated in FIG.
     4C. This system includes the pharmacy computer system 142 including a
     database 182 having patient information and the pharmacy-maintained RFID
     reader 143. This pharmacy computer system 142 is intended to inter-act
     with containers 176 that are equipped with the RFID container tag 130
     that, as indicated above, provides the container 176 with a particular
     container identification number. As further discussed above, the RFID
     container tag 130 is capable of emitting a signal including the container
     identification number. Operation of this embodiment of this system
     further relies on providing each of the plurality of medicinal tablets
     178 stored in the container 176 with a respective RFID tablet tag 130
     that provides a corresponding tablet 178 with a particular tablet
     identification number. Thus each of the RFID tablet tags 130 is enabled
     to emit a signal including its respective tablet identification number so
     that upon purchase, the pharmacy-maintained RFID reader 143 detects the
     RFID tags 130 and the particular container and tablet identification
     numbers are stored in the database 182 along with any new or prior
     related patient information. In cases where the tablets 178 may not yet
     contain RFID tags, the system may be advantageously applied to reading
     the container 176 RFID tags only. Thus in this manner, the pharmacy is
     ensured of selling only legitimately manufactured medications thus
     avoiding unintentional of counterfeit drugs into the hands of a patient.
<BR><BR>[0154]Now as the above system is accepted and implemented by drug
     manufactures and pharmacies, the inventors hereof believe that as the
     current generation of children, teenagers, and adults become ever more
     familiar with computers, PDAs, and daily on-line health and wellness
     activities, the PDPA 104 of the present invention will become common
     place. Thus concomitant therewith, the above system may be expanded to
     further include the portable digital patient assistant 104 for use by a
     patient during administration of the medicinal tablets in accordance with
     the teaching discussed in reference to FIG. 4B. Thus as illustrated in
     FIG. 4B, the portable digital patient assistant 104 is implemented to be
     connectable to the pharmacy computer system 142, and is similarly
     provided with the memory 122 and the RFID reader 116 capable of detecting
     the signals emitted by the respective RFID tags in the container 176
     and/or the tablets 178 so that upon use of the container and/or medicinal
     tablets 178, the RFID reader 116 detects the RFID tags 130 and the
     portable digital patient assistant 104 stores the particular container
     and tablet identification numbers in the memory. This stored information
     may be used initially to verify that the tables are not counterfeit and
     then thereafter further used during administration of the tablets at home
     according to doctor's instructions. Then on further use from a remote
     location, at home for example, the portable digital patient assistant 104
     is periodically linked to the pharmacy computer system to update same
     with patient information regarding the patient's use of medication. Upon
     further adoption and implementation hereof, this system may further be
     expanded to include the doctor office computer system 140 that is capable
     of being remotely accessed the portable digital patient assistant. Thus
     here also from a remote location, the portable digital patient assistant
     may be periodically linked to the doctor office computer system 140 to
     provide updates thereto including patient information regarding the
     patient's use of medication.
<BR><BR>[0155]As would be readily understood by those skilled in the art given the
     present disclosure, the PDPA 104 of the present invention as illustrated
     in particular in FIG. 4B may not in all applications require all of the
     elements and functionalities shown. In one simplified embodiment thereof,
     the PDPA 104 may include an RFID reader 116 and a simple output to
     indicate to a patient that the medications being use are authentic and
     supplied by a legitimate manufacture. Furthermore, use of the RFID tag
     130 is not intended herein to be limited to prescription drugs. The
     teaching hereof may be readily adapted to over-the-counter medications as
     well as used by manufactures of prescription drugs. Thus the present
     invention is further directed to a system for preventing use of
     counterfeit tablet medications. In one embodiment thereof, the system
     includes the portable digital patient assistant 104 for use by a patient
     during administration of tablet-type medicinal drugs. The portable
     digital patient assistant here includes a memory 122, an RFID reader 116,
     and an output 128. The memory is preferably enabled to store a plurality
     of tablet identification numbers and thus the RFID reader is capable of
     detecting signals emitted by respective RFID tags, and the output is
     enabled to provide information to the patient regarding manufacturing
     aspects of the tablet-type medicinal drugs. This system further includes
     a database stored in the memory, the database containing a plurality of
     tablet identification numbers each thereof associated with a respective
     RFID tablet tag included in each legitimately manufactured tablet
     provided in a container so that when the patient uses any respective
     tablet-type medicinal drug from the container, the RFID reader searches
     for a recognized tablet identification number and when so detected, the
     output of the portable digital patient assistant indicates that the
     respective tablet-type medicinal drug is authentic. So that this system
     may be used with subsequent purchases of medications, the portable
     digital patient assistant in this embodiment is connectable to a network
     so that the database may be updated with more current tablet
     identification numbers.
<BR><BR>[0156]In an alternate embodiment of this system, the portable digital
     patient assistant 104 is implemented for use by a patient during
     administration of tablet-type medicinal drugs provided in a tablet
     container 176 with a container RFID tag 130. The portable digital patient
     assistant 104 here also includes the memory 122, the RFID reader 116, and
     the output 128, the memory being enabled to store a plurality of tablet
     container identification numbers, the RFID reader capable of detecting
     signals emitted by respective RFID tags 130 associated with tablet
     containers 176, and the output enabled to provide information to the
     patient regarding manufacturing aspects of the tablet containers 176. In
     this manner when the reader detects a known container identification
     number and the container has not been tampered with, the patient is
     assured of receiving legitimate medications. As with the related
     embodiment described just above, this system also includes a database
     stored in the memory, the database containing a plurality of tablet
     container identification numbers each thereof associated with a
     respective RFID tablet container tag included in each legitimately
     manufactured tablet container so that when the patient uses any
     respective tablet container, the RFID reader searches for a recognized
     tablet container identification number and when so detected, the output
     of the portable digital patient assistant indicates that the respective
     tablet container is authentic. Here also, the portable digital patient
     assistant 104 is connectable to a network so that the database may be
     updated with more current tablet container identification numbers.
<BR><BR>[0157]FIG. 4D is a flow chart of one particular illustrative method
     employed in conjunction with the present portable digital patient
     assistant 104 during a patient visit to the pharmacy. This method begins
     with a start step 184 when the patient arrives at the pharmacy. Upon
     arrival, the patient hands his PDPA to the pharmacist or other authorized
     pharmacy employee. This step is analogous to the current prior art
     practice where the written prescription, insurance card, personal ID, and
     credit card may all be required. In the next step of the method shown in
     FIG. 4D, server-detected step 186, the patient's PDPA then performs a
     processing task to determine whether a relevant pharmacy server has been
     detected. These initial steps may be similar or the same as the
     corresponding steps illustrated in FIG. 3B with regard to the doctor's
     office visit. Alternatively they may be implemented in any suitable
     alternate manner according to the specific needs, requirements, and
     particulars of the pharmacy environment. Once step 186 is completed and a
     link between the PDPA and pharmacy server is initiated, a security-check
     step 188 is performed. This check may include a hand-shake between the
     PDPA RFID tag 129 (FIG. 4B) and the pharmacy reader 143 (FIG. 4B). In the
     case where the security-check step 188 has failed, then the security
     problem is addressed at a correct-security-problem step 190. The security
     check subroutine here is discussed below in further detail with reference
     to FIG. 4E. In the case where the security-check step 188 is positive or
     confirmed as "OK", then the method proceeds to the next step which is an
     upload-prescription step 192. After the prescription has been uploaded
     into the pharmacy server at the upload-prescription step 192, the method
     then proceeds to a meets-dose-guideline step 194. Here at step 194 if the
     uploaded prescription does not meet dose guidelines, for example the dose
     is too high for the patient's body weight or the newly uploaded
     prescription is in conflict with another drug the patient is then
     currently taking, then the pharmacy server and computer system provide an
     indication to the pharmacist that the patient needs to go back to the
     doctor as illustrated by back-to-doctor step 196. On the other hand, if
     the meets-dose-guideline step 194 is a "yes" and thus the newly uploaded
     prescription confirmed as OK for the patient, the illustrated method next
     proceeds to a date-check step 198. In the case where the date-check step
     198 has failed or is a "no", the method then proceeds to a see-pharmacist
     step 200. And thereafter the method loops back to the
     meets-dose-guideline step 194. In the case where the date-check step 198
     has passed or is a "yes", the method next proceeds to a
     write-prescription-identification step 202. Here the container and tablet
     identification numbers are written to the pharmacy database and also
     written to the memory in the patient PDPA. As described above, these
     identification numbers are obtained by an RFID reader that reads the RFID
     tags manufactured into the container or the container and tablets.
     Thereafter, the method proceeds to a how-to-take step 204 where
     directions for taking, such as "on full stomach", "twice-a-day",
     "avoid-milk", are outputted on the PDPA display. Thereafter this
     particular method ends and the patient leaves the pharmacy for further
     home-use of the PDPA and RFID enabled container and tablets.
<BR><BR>[0158]FIG. 4E is a flow chart of one particular representative
     security-check subroutine that may be utilized in the pharmacy visit
     method illustrated in FIG. 4D. The illustrated security-check subroutine
     in particular starts with a power-up-self-test 228. Here when the PDPA is
     turned-on, a diagnostic self-test is run to ensure the system is
     functioning properly. The next step is a server-detected step 230. Here
     if no server is detected the system remains on stand-by mode waiting to
     detect a recognized server or an RFID tag. On the other hand when a
     recognized server is detected, the method proceeds to a security-present
     step 232. In the event no pre-arranged security is present, the method
     directs the user to a set-up-security step 234. In the case where a
     pre-arranged security is present, the method then directs the user to a
     doctor-office-inquiry step 236. If the answer here is a "yes" then the
     system is directed to the method discussed in conjunction with FIG. 3B.
     If the answer to step 236 is no, the system conducts a pharmacy inquiry
     step 230. If the answer here is a "yes" then the system is directed to
     the method discussed in conjunction with FIG. 4D. Next the method
     proceeds to a check-ID-and-initiate step 240. Here the password is
     initiated and cookies polling is performed. Thereafter the method
     proceeds to a password-correct step 242. If the password is incorrect,
     the method of this particular embodiment goes idle. When the password is
     correct, the method proceeds to a confirm-appointment-with-server step
     244, then to an allow-data-transfer step 246, and next to a
     visit-finished step 248. If the visit has not finished at that time, the
     method loops back to the allow-data-transfer step 246. Once the current
     doctor's office visit or transaction is finished, the method proceeds to
     a close-record-and-update-data step 250. Here after the visit is finished
     and all medical services are rendered or completed, or the pharmacy
     transactions are completed, the method closes the record for that visit
     and updates data in both the server and the PDPA.
<BR><BR>[0159]Given the present disclosure, the methods illustrated in FIGS. 4D
     and 4E may be readily modified as desired to suite any other particular
     needs of the pharmacy environment.
<BR><BR>[0160]Thus the present invention is further directed to a method for
     facilitating a patient's visit to a pharmacy. In one particular
     embodiment thereof, the method includes the steps of (a) arriving at a
     pharmacy with a portable patient assistant device including a memory
     having stored patient data, an input for receiving data into the device,
     and an output for outputting information from the device to a remote
     location; (b) connecting the portable patient assistant device to a
     pharmacy computer system; (c) transferring at least some of the stored
     patient data from the memory to the pharmacy computer system; (d)
     updating patient data in the pharmacy computer system; and (e) filling
     any prescriptions for medications indicated by the transferring step.
<BR><BR>[0161]In an alternate embodiment of this method for facilitating a
     patient's visit to a pharmacy, the method includes the steps of (a)
     arriving at a pharmacy with a portable patient assistant device including
     a memory having stored patient data, an input for receiving data into the
     device, and an output for outputting information from the device to a
     remote location; (b) connecting the portable patient assistant device to
     a pharmacy computer system; (c) connecting the pharmacy computer system
     to an insurance company computer system; (d) transferring at least some
     of the stored patient data from the memory to the pharmacy computer
     system; (e) transferring at least some of the transferred patient data
     from the pharmacy computer system to the insurance company computer
     system; (f) updating patient data in the pharmacy computer system; and
     (g) filling any prescriptions for medications indicated by the by at
     least one of the transferring steps. This method may advantageously
     include the additional steps of receiving updated insurance data from the
     insurance company computer system, and storing the updated insurance data
     from the insurance company computer system in the pharmacy computer
     system when so desired. Additionally or alternatively, the further step
     of storing the updated insurance data from the insurance company computer
     system in the portable patient assistant device may be implemented when
     needed or desired. Such embodiments may also include, when desired and
     suitable, the step of transferring the updated insurance data from the
     pharmacy computer system into the portable patient assistant device.
<BR><BR>[0162]Referring next to FIG. 5A, there is shown the patient 102 wearing
     the PDPA 104 in an ambulance 110 on the way to a hospital 112. As
     employed in the ambulance 110 and the hospital 112, the PDPA 104 may be
     linked to an on-board patient monitoring system 249 which would include
     the ambulance computer 136 (FIG. 2C) and its cooperative RFID reader 137
     (FIG. 2C). The system 249 may include the computer 136 with a database
     and a viewing monitor or video output screen. The on-board patient
     monitoring system 249 according to the present invention is adapted to
     make a communications connection with the patient's PDPA as illustrated.
     In this manner, the on-board patient monitoring system 249 is
     advantageously updated with all information contained in the patient's
     PDPA or any portion thereof that may be controlled by appropriate
     security protocols to protect privacy. As further represented in FIG. 5A,
     the on-board patient monitoring system 249 is wirelessly connected to the
     hospital, the patient's doctor, and the insurance companies. Thus
     according to a particular method relating to this aspect of the present
     invention, when a patient using the PDPA of the present invention needs
     an emergency ambulance trip to the hospital, his PDPA is connected to the
     on-board patient monitoring system while in transit, information from his
     PDPA is uploaded into the on-board patient monitoring system, and this
     information is then sent to the hospital's administration office, medical
     personnel waiting in the hospital emergency room, the patient's doctor,
     and his insurance company. In this manner the time in the ambulance is
     advantageously use to inform and alert. Thus in advance of the patient's
     arrival at the ER, the hospital, insurance company, and his doctor are
     fully updated with both personal information and medical information.
<BR><BR>[0163]According to a further aspect hereof, once the hospital has the
     updated information from the patient's PDPA and additional input from the
     examination taking place in the ambulance by the paramedics and
     additional on-board equipment, the hospital can transmit back to the
     patient's PDPA additional information such as assigned ER room, assigned
     doctor, and type of treatments needed. Thus when the patient arrives at
     the hospital, his PDPA is then used by hospital staff.
<BR><BR>[0164]Information from the PDPA provided to the on-board patient
     monitoring system 249 of the ambulance 110, may include all necessary
     personal information, medical history, past prescriptions and current
     prescriptions. The PDPA may be updated by the hospital to display what
     procedure is to be scheduled, area of the body for surgery (e.g. abdomen,
     arm--left or right), assigned to what operating room and the time and
     date of surgery. A cross check for allergies and bad reactions can be
     performed with the built in library stored in the PDPA. One advantage of
     the present system and methods is that the PDPA and hospital computer are
     in communication during the ambulance ride. This saves time and can be a
     critical factor in saving lives.
<BR><BR>[0165]After arrival at the hospital, the patient's PDPA can be used
     advantageously whether or not it was employed during an ambulance ride to
     the hospital as described above. The inventors hereof thus propose that
     the present PDPA can be employed by patients and hospitals in a similar
     manner as described above in connection with visits to the doctor's
     office, FIG. 3A, and visits to the pharmacy, FIG. 4A. Thus in the setting
     of the surgery clinic, the PDPA unit can be programmed to (1) display
     what procedure is scheduled for the patient, (2) indicate what type of
     surgery (abdominal, cardiac, brain surgery, or others as indicated), (3)
     identify the location/site of surgery (e.g. in the abdomen or the thorax,
     in the arm or leg: left or right arm), and (4) help keep tract of which
     patient is assigned to what operating room, at what day of the week, and
     at what time of the day. The PDPA can further be employed to help cross
     check for allergies and adverse reactions with a built in library. All of
     the above can be downloaded and updated in real time with the hospital
     computer while the patient is in hospital or at home. In the setting of a
     network of associated hospitals (for example the Kaiser system or the VA
     system), these data can also be accessed across the country. Thus more
     specifically, this aspect of the present invention is further directed to
     a system for dispatching information during a medical emergency. One
     embodiment of this system advantageously includes (i) the PDPA 104
     adapted for use by a patient during an ambulance ride to a hospital
     emergency room. In this embodiment, the portable digital patient
     assistant preferably includes the memory 122, the processor 118, the
     output 128, and a communications link such as the USB connection or
     wireless transmitter 146 as shown in FIG. 2C. The memory as discussed
     above is preferably updated with current personal and medical information
     about the patient. This system further includes the on-board patient
     monitoring system 249 associated with the ambulance 110 represented in
     FIG. 5A. The on-board patient monitoring system 249 is adapted to include
     a communications link compatible with the communications link of the
     portable digital patient assistant so that information may be transferred
     from the portable digital patient assistant to the on-board patient
     monitoring system during the ambulance ride to the hospital. In a further
     embodiment hereof, the on-board patient monitoring system includes
     wireless connectability to remote networks so that information received
     from the portable digital patient assistant may be sent to a selected
     remote network for further processing. As discussed above, these remote
     networks may include, for example, the hospital administration office,
     the ER at the hospital, the patient's doctor's office, and the patient's
     insurance company. Other remote networks may include the Internet so that
     during the ambulance ride, emails may be automatically sent to emergency
     contacts and/or loved-ones listed and stored in the patient's PDPA.
<BR><BR>[0166]FIG. 5B is a flow chart of one particular representative method
     employed in conjunction with the present portable digital patient
     assistant during an emergency visit to the hospital. This illustrative
     method starts with step 251 to determine whether the server is detected
     and next proceeds to a security check step 252. If the security step 252
     fails, the system goes idle, when passed, the system proceeds to step 254
     where the on-board patient monitoring system 249, FIG. 5A, and the
     patient's PDPA are linked and placed in operative communication with each
     other. Next at step 256, the patient's insurance information is verified.
     Thereafter the information is transferred to the ER computer at step 258.
     When the patient arrives at the ER, step 260, the system checks for a
     connection to the server at step 262. Next is step 264 where another
     security check is performed, and if this check point is passed, the
     system then inquires whether the emergency is taken care of at step 266,
     if so the PDPA is updated at step 268 as indicated.
<BR><BR>[0167]With reference next to FIG. 6A, there is shown a pictorial
     representation of an individual 102 wearing his portable digital patient
     assistant 104 in a home environment. The inventors hereof propose several
     different uses of the present PDPA in the home environment. One principal
     aspect of home use includes the home computer 132 which as discussed in
     conjunction with FIG. 2C above is adapted to receive an operative
     connection with the PDPA 104. This may be implemented with use of the
     docking station 148, a USB connection, or a wireless discussion as
     discussed above. As illustrated in FIG. 6A, the PDPA 104 when connected
     to the home computer 132 may in turn be connected in real time to any one
     of a number of different health, wellness, or medical networks or
     websites such as, for example, the hospital, the doctor's office, the
     Internet generally, any secure medical LAN which may be associated with a
     particular doctor's office or hospital, the patient's medical or dental
     insurance company, and the patient's local pharmacy. In this manner, the
     PDPA 104 may be updated from any of these links and may also upload
     updated information to any of these remote locations. For example, if the
     patient goes to the doctor and the doctor prescribes a medication, the
     patient has the option of going home rather than to the pharmacy. Next
     the patient docks his PDPA in his home computer and the updated
     prescription information may be directed to the pharmacy. This saves a
     trip to the pharmacy. The patient may then visit the pharmacy later, or
     the pharmacy may deliver the prescription to the patient's home by
     delivery person, shipping service, or mail. In this manner the
     inter-connectability between the PDPA 104, the home computer 132, and
     medical servers and networked computer systems may be readily achieved.
<BR><BR>[0168]With continuing reference to FIG. 6A now taken in conjunction with
     FIG. 8, another principal aspect of home use of the portable digital
     patient assistant 104 includes the RFID functionality of the PDPA. As
     discussed above, the PDPA may be advantageously implemented to include
     the RFID reader 116 which detects the presence of an RFID tablet 178.
     This principal aspect of the present invention and RFID-implemented PDPA
     will be discussed in further detail below in the following section
     directed to patient use of ingestible medications.
<BR><BR>[0169]Now with reference to FIG. 6B, there is shown a flow chart of one
     particular illustrative method employed in conjunction with the present
     portable digital patient assistant during home use. This method does not
     necessarily depend upon the RFID functionalities disclosed and discussed
     herein. The method of FIG. 6B begins with a server detection step 270,
     and then proceeds to a security check step 272. If the security check at
     step 272 is passed, the method proceeds to step 274 where the PDPA sounds
     a tone and displays a reminder message for the patient to take prescribed
     medication. If security step 272 is not passed, the PDPA goes to idle. At
     next step 276, the directions of how to take the medication are display
     on the PDPA. This may include an output such as "on-full-stomach",
     "without-milk", or the like. This method then proceeds to the next step
     278 to determine whether the dose was taken properly. If the answer is a
     "no" here, the system will then display further information or
     instructions relating to remedial action. In one preferred embodiment of
     this method, the PDPA here may prompt the user to input information as to
     why the dose was not proper. If the inquiry at step 278 is affirmative,
     then the method proceeds to step 280 to inquire whether the prescription
     regime is still open. If the answer here is a "no", then the method
     proceeds to step 286 where a new doctor's appointment may be scheduled or
     the prescription is refilled. Refilling here may take place by the
     patient docking his PDPA in his home computer 132 as illustrated in FIG.
     6A, sending a refill request to the doctor's office, receiving the refill
     authorization, and then forwarding same to the pharmacy. If the answer to
     step 280 in FIG. 6B is a "yes" the present method next proceeds to step
     282 where a next-time-dose-is-due inquiry is performed. Here if the next
     dose is due in 8 hours, for example, the method will proceed to step 284
     to check whether there is still some medication left in the patient's
     possession. In the case where there is still some medication left, the
     PDPA will be programmed to give a reminder in 8 hours and the method
     proceeds back to step 274. If at step 284 the prescription is exhausted,
     i.e. no medication left, then the method proceeds to step 286 where a new
     doctor's appointment may be scheduled or the prescription is refilled. In
     either of these cases, at step 288 a reminder to visit the doctor or get
     the refill takes place. If at step 286 no refill or doctor's follow
     appointment is necessary, then the method ends.
<BR><BR>[0170]FIG. 7 is a general flow chart of various functions and aspects that
     are performed by the portable digital patient assistant of the present
     invention including certain RFID aspects hereof when a patient makes a
     visit to the doctor's office. For further ease of readability and
     explanation, reference numbers will continue to be employed in FIG. 7.
     The method of FIG. 7 begins with step 290 inquiring whether PDPA RFID tag
     129 (FIGS. 2C and 4B) in range is initialized; if not, then patient
     information is registered at step 292. If the PDPA RFID tag 129 has been
     initialized at step 290, the method proceeds to step 294 to determine
     whether the patient is at the doctor's office. If not, the system returns
     to step 290. As would be apparent to one of skill in the art given the
     present disclosure, this step and the resulting subsequent steps could be
     readily reprogrammed to address whether the patient was at a hospital,
     pharmacy, dentist's office, physical therapy session, at the gym
     exercising, out for a walk, or any other routine associated with health,
     wellness, or medical treatment for which the PDPA of the present
     invention may be adapted. Now if the patient is at the doctor's office
     according to the method of FIG. 7, a security check is performed at step
     296. This security check may be a handshake between the PDPA tag and the
     doctor's reader. If this security check is not passed, the method returns
     to step 290 as illustrated. If the security step is passed, the method
     proceeds next to step 298 where an update of medical history and any
     prescriptions are inputted to the PDPA. In the case where new
     prescriptions are pending, step 300, the PDPA will periodically display a
     "go-to-pharmacy" reminder and issue a sound indicator similar to the
     sound indication on a cell phone when a message has been left. If no new
     prescriptions are pending at step 300, this particular subroutine returns
     to step 294 and awaits a next doctor's office visit. After this method
     displays the "go-to-pharmacy" reminder and issues sound indicators, the
     patient should then proceed to the pharmacy. Now at the pharmacy, the
     pharmacy RFID reader interrogates the patient's PDPA at step 304 and
     determines if an RFID tag is associated with the PDPA. Here if there is
     no tag associated with the particular PDPA, the method proceeds back to
     300. When a tag is found, the method then proceeds to step 306 where
     another security check is performed. If this security check is not
     passed, then the method proceeds to step 308 for correction. If the
     security step 306 is passed, then the method proceeds next to step 310
     and allows prescription uploading. At step 312 a prescription cross check
     is performed with the new prescription in the PDPA. At step 314, the
     system performs a drug-conflict test with the build-in drug library of
     the PDPA. If the system detects a conflict, the patient is sent back to
     the doctor at step 316. If there is no drug conflict, then the method
     proceeds to step 318 to verify that the prescription is correct. If the
     prescription is incorrect at this point in the process, the PDPA sounds a
     warning at step 320, and then directs the patient to see the pharmacist
     at step 322. If at step 318, the prescription is determined to be
     correct, then the method next proceeds to step 324 to display the
     instructions for the new prescription and conduct a cross-check with the
     prescription guidelines stored in the PDPA. The method of FIG. 7 then
     next proceeds to step 326 where all the RFID tags in the prescribed new
     medication are polled. Now the patient's PDPA is fully loaded with
     pill-by-pill information, each pill or tablet in the allotment having a
     unique ID by virtue of each respective RFID tag. At this point in the
     process, the patient is preferably still at the pharmacy so that if any
     problems arise during the polling of the RFID tags in the allotment of
     new medication, the pharmacist may be consulted. However, it is proposed
     by the inventors hereof that the methods and systems of the present
     invention described in connection with FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C would prevent
     any errors at this point in the current method. Thus at step 326 the
     prescription is filled and the patient returns home. The next step of
     this particular method continues while the patient is at home. Here at
     step 328, the subroutine inquires whether the correct dose is taken and
     if not, then method returns to step 324 for display of instructions and
     guidelines. If the correct does is taken at step 328, then at step 330
     the PDPA is set for a time when the next dose is due and the routine
     return to step 324.
<BR><BR>[0171]As the current generation of children, teenagers, and adults become
     ever more familiar with computers, PDAs, on-line activities, and related
     electronic apparatus and methods for receiving, processing, and
     distributing information; the inventors hereof believe that both current
     and future generations of patients, doctors, and medical staff will adopt
     the devices, methods, and systems disclosed herein with great ease and
     acceptability such that use of all the different inventive aspects hereof
     become as second nature as texting a message or making a telephone call.
<BR><BR>Patient Use of Ingestible Medications
<BR><BR>[0172]According to another principal aspect of the present invention, the
     PDPA in conjunction with certain RFID components and methods may be
     advantageously employed to monitor patient use of ingestible medications.
     Before proceeding with this detailed description of the present
     invention, various aspects and inter-related functions of the PDPA will
     be further presented next.
<BR><BR>[0173]The PDPA of the present invention in one principal embodiment is
     preferably a one program dedicated computer. It includes all the basic
     components of a standard computer such as a CPU, memory, as well as an
     input and output. However instead of a hard drive, a flash memory is
     used. Here memory and the operating system work together as a team. The
     static RAM memory is one of the most essential parts of this team. Flash
     memory and static RAM are used due to the need for low power consumption.
     From the moment the PDPA is turned on until shut down, the CPU is
     constantly using memory.
<BR><BR>[0174]In one typical scenario when the PDPA is first turned on, the PDPA
     loads data from the flash memory (where the patient information and the
     drug library are also stored) and performs a power-on self-test (POST) to
     make sure all the major components are functioning properly. As part of
     this test, the memory controller checks all of the memory addresses with
     a quick read/write operation to ensure that there are no errors in the
     memory chips. Read/write means that data is written to a bit and then
     read from that bit. Next the PDPA loads the input/output system (I/O)
     from the flash ROM. The I/O provides the most basic information about
     storage devices, boot sequence, security, RFID reader, wireless
     communication (auto device recognition) capability and a few other items.
     Next the RFID reader transmits and responds to an RFID tag embedded pill
     178 when in proximity. Then the PDPA loads the program from flash memory
     into the system's RAM. This allows the CPU to have immediate access to
     the operating system, which enhances the performance and functionality of
     the overall system. When the I/O request criteria are met, the
     instruction set in the flash memory is loaded into RAM. Lastly, the CPU
     processes and saves updated information into the flash memory.
<BR><BR>[0175]Now with reference again to FIGS. 6A and 8, the principal aspect of
     home use of the portable digital patient assistant 104 including the RFID
     functionality of the PDPA will be described in further detail. As
     discussed above, the PDPA may be advantageously implemented to include
     the RFID reader 116 which detects the presence of an RFID tablet 178.
<BR><BR>[0176]Now with reference to FIG. 9, there is shown a perspective view of
     the bottle-type container 176 including an anti-tamper RFID-tag 130
     assembly according to another aspect of the present invention. As shown,
     the tag 130 includes a long antenna 332 which traverses across the
     partition line between the neck of the bottle and the bottle cap. Here
     before the patient opens the container 176 for the first time, the RFID
     reader in the PDPA polls for the RFID tag 130. In the case where the
     container 176 has not been tampered with, the tag 130 will send a proper
     signal to the PDPA to ensure the patient that the medication in the
     container is from the trusted manufacture and was not tampered with
     during transport in the distribution channel. On the other hand, if the
     container had been opened after the time from when it left the secure
     custody of the manufacture and before it came into possession of the
     patient, the antenna 332 would be broken and a proper signal could not be
     sent to the PDPA for verification of purity. Thus this aspect of the
     present invention gives an indication that the container has been
     tampered with and thereby possibly filled with counterfeit medication
     when the antenna 332 is broken. It should be understood here that the
     RFID tag 130 in the container 176 is provided by the manufacture. This
     gives each and every bottle of medication a unique identification number
     which can be tracked from the manufacture to the time of consumption by
     the patient. These identification numbers may be stored is secure
     databases and shared as needed to implement the systems and methods
     disclosed herein. It should be further understood that this aspect of the
     present invention is not limited to prescription drugs, but may be
     applied to any bottle-cap combination whether the bottle contains
     over-the-counter cough medicine or any other consumable that is ingested
     by an end user. Thus this aspect of the present invention is readily
     adapted to any bottle-cap combination where the contents are valuable and
     preventing counterfeiting is desirable and thus may be applied to, for
     example, liquors and spirits, bottled waters including particularly those
     from well known or exclusive springs, and expensive perfumes to name a
     few.
<BR><BR>[0177]FIG. 10 is a partial anatomical diagram showing a patient after
     taking a medication 178 including an RFID-tag 130 in conjunction with the
     portable digital patient assistant 104 according to the present
     invention. Here the PDPA is employed to track the tablet 178 in the
     patient after ingesting. Thus one aspect hereof includes counting the
     number of tablets taken by the patient. When the PDPA is not in proximity
     with the container, but in close range with the patient only a normal
     dose of the medication should be detect by the PDPA. Thus this aspect of
     the present invention may be applied to detecting and preventing an
     overdose of drugs, whether the overdose is intentional or unintentional.
     As further illustrated in FIG. 10, the present PDPA is in communication
     with a wide range of networks. Thus in the case of a detected overdose,
     the PDPA may be programmed to automatically send a warning to not only
     the patient but to any other caretaker or medical personnel connected to
     any one of the illustrated networks.
<BR><BR>[0178]Thus the present invention is directed to system for monitoring use
     of ingested medications. One embodiment of this system includes a
     container 176 including (1) an RFID container tag 130 that provides the
     container with a particular container identification number, the RFID
     container tag capable of emitting a signal including the container
     identification number; (2) a plurality of medicinal tablets stored in the
     container, each of the medicinal tablets including an RFID tablet tag 130
     that provides a corresponding respective tablet with a particular tablet
     identification number, each of the RFID tablet tags capable of emitting a
     signal including its respective tablet identification number; and (3) a
     portable digital patient assistant 104 for use by a patient 102 during
     administration of the medicinal tablets, the portable digital patient
     assistant including an RFID reader 116 and a communications output 128,
     the RFID reader capable of detecting the signals emitted by the
     respective RFID tags and the communications output enabled to send
     information regarding the administration to a remote location.
<BR><BR>[0179]The system according to this particular embodiment may further
     include a processor 118 operatively linked with the RFID reader 116, the
     processor enabled to determine a count of medicinal tablets 178.
<BR><BR>[0180]In an alternative embodiment, the PDPA 104 includes a processor 118
     operatively linked with the RFID reader 116, the processor 118 enabled to
     determine a count of medicinal tablets 178 and whether the number of
     counted medicinal tablets is still stored within the container 178 by
     analyzing the signals returned from the RFID container tag and the RFID
     tablet tags.
<BR><BR>[0181]And yet in an alternate embodiment, the PDPA 104 may include a
     processor 118 operatively linked with the RFID reader 116, the processor
     118 enabled to determine a count of medicinal tablets 178 and whether the
     number of counted medicinal tablets have been ingested by the patient by
     analyzing the signals returned from the RFID tablet tags relative to any
     signal returned from the RFID container tag.
<BR><BR>[0182]Now as illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 10 this system may advantageously
     further include the controller 120 operatively linked with the processor
     118, the controller 120 enabled to activate the communications output 128
     in a predetermined manner.
<BR><BR>[0183]Further, the PDPA may be programmed so that when the count of
     medicinal tablets 178 ingested by the patient 102 exceeds a set
     threshold, the controller 120 activates the communications output 128 to
     send a distress signal to the remote location to thereby indicate a
     possibility of a drug overdose.
<BR><BR>[0184]These and many other advantages, methods, and applications would be
     readily apparent to those of skill in the art given the present
     disclosure.
<BR><BR>[0185]As the current generation of children, teenagers, and adults become
     ever more familiar with computers, PDAs, on-line activities, and related
     electronic apparatus and methods for receiving, processing, and
     distributing information; the inventors hereof believe that both current
     and future generations of patients, doctors, and medical staff will adopt
     the devices, methods, and systems disclosed herein with great ease and
     acceptability such that use of all the different inventive aspects hereof
     become as second nature as texting a message or making a telephone call.
<BR><BR>Counterfeit Drug Prevention
<BR><BR>[0186]In accordance with yet another principal aspect of the present
     invention, the PDPA in conjunction with certain RFID components and
     methods may be advantageously employed to prevent the distribution of
     counterfeit drugs. Additional aspects of this invention involve use of
     RFID tags in the manufacturing of drugs.
<BR><BR>[0187]With reference now to FIG. 11A, there is shown a perspective
     representation of capsule-type medications 334 being made according to
     certain manufacturing methods of the present invention. Here in the
     manufacture, a respective RFID-tag 130 is inserted into each capsule 334.
     FIG. 11B is a perspective representation of pill-type medications 336
     being made according to the manufacturing methods of the present
     invention. Here also in the manufacture, a respective RFID-tag 130 is
     inserted into each pill 336. The RFID tags 130 each include a unique
     identification number. The memory in the tag 130 is preferably on the
     order of 1K bits and 32 or 64 bit encryption may be employed to create
     each tablet ID. Each individual tag 130 may also include additional
     information such as, for example, date of manufacture, date of
     expiration, lot number, drug codes from the Physicians' Desk Reference
     (PDR codes), food to avoid, and similar information that may be useful or
     desirable when provided in combination with the functionalities of the
     PDPA. As RFID tag technology advances, the inventors hereof believe that
     even more information and longer, more secure IDs may be programmed into
     the next generations of RFID tags.
<BR><BR>[0188]FIG. 12A is a perspective representation of individual doses of
     medication or tablets 178 each including an RFID-tag 130 being bottled
     according to certain manufacturing and packaging methods of the present
     invention. As shown, each bottle 176 includes a cap 338 with an RFID tag
     130 as previously discussed above in connection with FIG. 9. Now
     according to the manufacturing aspects hereof, as the individual tablets
     178 fill each bottle 176, a manufacturer's RFID reader 340 records each
     tablet ID and its associated bottle's ID. These IDs are then stored in a
     manufacturer's database 342 and then made available in a manufacturer's
     or company server 344 as discussed in further detail below.
<BR><BR>[0189]Next referring to FIG. 12B, there is shown a perspective
     representation of filled bottle-type containers 176 of medication each
     including an RFID-tag 130 being boxed according to certain manufacturing
     and packaging methods of the present invention. As illustrated, each box
     346 includes a box RFID tag 348. As in the case shown in FIG. 12A with
     individual tablets 178 and containers 176, the manufacturer's RFID reader
     340 here reads each box tag 348 and makes a record in the database 342 of
     each box ID, which bottles 176 are contained in a particular box 346, and
     which individual tablets 178 are contained in each bottle 176.
<BR><BR>[0190]FIG. 12C is a perspective representation of filled boxes 346 of
     medication each including an RFID-tag and being stacked and palletized
     according to certain packaging methods of the present invention. Here the
     manufacturer's RFID reader 340 reads and verifies each box tag 348, each
     bottle tag, and each tablet tag and makes a record of all such IDs being
     loaded onto a particular pallet 350. FIG. 12D is a perspective
     representation of a completed stack or pallet 350 of boxes 346 of
     medication. As illustrated, the completed pallet or stack of boxes 350
     includes a pallet RFID tag 352. Here again the manufacturer's RFID reader
     340 reads and verifies the pallet tag 352, each box tag 348, each bottle
     tag, and each tablet tag and makes a record of all such IDs being
     prepared for shipment.
<BR><BR>[0191]As further illustrated in FIG. 12D, the manufacturer's server 344
     may be advantageously connected to a secure LAN 354, which may then be
     connected to a wholesalers' network 356, which in turn is connected to a
     retailers' network which, as shown, may include the pharmacy computer
     142. The as the RFID tablets near the end of the distribution channel as
     offered for sale in the pharmacy, the PDPA 104 of the present invention
     enters the picture and records individual tables ID numbers as discussed
     above.
<BR><BR>[0192]Next shown in FIG. 12E is a perspective representation of an
     RFID-enabled inventory tracking system 359 according to the present
     invention. The inventory tracking system 359 includes a gateway 360, RFID
     detectors 362 located within the gateway 360 as illustrated, an RFID
     reader 364, a database 366, and a server 368. The RFID detectors 362 are
     operatively connected to the RFID reader 364 which is in cooperative
     communication with the database 366 and the server 368. As would be
     appreciated by those skilled in the art, the detectors 362 and the RFID
     reader 364 may be implemented in a single integrated component.
<BR><BR>[0193]With continuing reference now to FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12D and 12E, the
     inventory tracking system 359 is representative of any security check
     point through which any of the pallets 350, boxes 346, containers 176, or
     individual tablets 178 may pass while in the distribution channel from
     the manufacture to the pharmacy. For example, the gateway 360 may be
     first configured at the rear loading dock of the manufacturer's plant. In
     similar fashion, the gateway 360 may be configured as the rear doors of a
     truck parked at the manufacturer's loading dock. Thus in this manner, as
     the pallet 350 is transferred from the manufacturing plant to the truck,
     the information recorded inventory tracking systems for both the trucking
     company and the manufacture may be compared to determine whether there
     were any shipping irregularities such as theft by counterfeiters. The
     trucking company working cooperatively with the manufacture and the
     wholesale and/or retail distribution channels can then apply the gateway
     and inventory check to both loading at the plant and unloading at
     warehouses, distribution points, or retail stores. Similarly, the gateway
     360 and associated tracking system 359 may be configured as part of the
     cargo door of a plane or ship, and, in warehousing during distribution,
     part of the loading docks or doors of warehouse facilities. As the
     RFID-enabled product thus moves through the wholesale and retail
     distribution channels, several gateways and associated tracking systems
     may be implemented to keep tight control over inventory shipments. Each
     of these respective gateways can be cooperatively integrated with, for
     example, the wholesale 356 and retail 358 networks illustrated in FIG.
     12D. One principal advantage of the present system over others such as
     those that rely on hand-held scanners, is that no personnel are required
     and individual bottles or tablets can be read without having to open the
     pallet, boxes, or containers as the case may be. Thus according to this
     aspect of the present invention counterfeiting of drugs may be prevented.
     And as discussed above in connection with FIG. 9, these shipping,
     packaging, and inventory control systems and methods of the present
     invention may be similarly and readily adapted to other products where
     the contents are valuable and preventing counterfeiting is desirable. It
     should therefore be understood by those skilled in related arts, given
     the present disclosure, that these particular aspects may be applied to,
     for example, liquors and spirits, bottled waters including particularly
     those from well known or exclusive springs, and expensive perfumes to
     name a few.
<BR><BR>[0194]FIG. 13 is a general flow chart of certain principal steps in a one
     embodiment of a system-wide method according to the drug manufacturing
     and shipping aspects of this invention. This method starts at the drug
     manufacturing company with step 370 where the manufacture makes a pill or
     capsule with an embedded RFID tag. Next at step 372, the RFID tags are
     registered with the manufacture's main frame server. Then at step 374,
     the medications including the embedded RFID tags are packaged. This
     packing step 372 may include any one of more of the additional RFID tags
     discussed in FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12C, and 12D. The packaged product is then
     disbursed to the distribution chain or channel in step 376. During this
     step, any number of gateways 360 and their associated inventory tracking
     systems 359 (FIG. 12E) may be employed as discussed. As further
     discussed, these systems may be linked together and all in turn linked,
     directly or indirectly, to the manufacture's main frame server. Next at
     step 378 shown in FIG. 13, the RFID embedded medical tablets arrive at
     health centers or pharmacies. And then a counterfeit and tamper proof
     check is performed at step 380. Here the pharmacy computer and pharmacy
     RFID reader may be employed to verify the legitimacy of the received
     produce. The check 380 may also be performed by the PDPA both at the
     point of sale, and then again during home use.
<BR><BR>[0195]As the current generation of children, teenagers, and adults become
     ever more familiar with computers, PDAs, daily on-line activities, and
     related electronic apparatus and methods for receiving, processing, and
     distributing information; the inventors hereof believe that current and
     future generations of patients, doctors, and medical staff will adopt the
     devices, methods, and systems disclosed herein with great ease and
     acceptability such that use of all the different inventive aspects hereof
     become as second nature as making a telephone call.
<BR><BR>[0196]While this invention has been described in detail with reference to
     certain preferred embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present
     invention is not limited to those precise embodiments. Rather, in view of
     the present disclosure which describes the current best mode for
     practicing the invention, many modifications and variations would present
     themselves to those of skill in the art without departing from the scope
     and spirit of this invention. The scope of the invention is, therefore,
     indicated by the following claims rather than by the foregoing
     description. All changes, modifications, and variations coming within the
     meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be considered
     within their scope.
