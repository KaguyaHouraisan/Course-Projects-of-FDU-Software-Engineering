<BR><BR>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0001]The invention is directed, in general, to securing property and,
     more specifically, to a cryptographic lock, a method of operating a
     cryptographic lock and a secure container employing a cryptographic lock.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002]Locks are used to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of
     property. The types of locks used can vary depending on the property to
     be protected. For example, various locks are used to protect property
     ranging from homes to containers of all sizes.
<BR><BR>[0003]Though locks may take many different forms, most locks are
     mechanical or electromechanical. A key, appropriate to one or a group of
     locks, is typically used to open the lock. Depending upon the type of
     lock, the key may be a physical structure or a combination of numbers,
     such as a sequence or authentication code. Thus, while locks may limit
     unauthorized access to property, locks also limit authorized access to
     property by requiring a user to have an appropriate key for the lock.
     Authorized users, therefore, must keep the appropriate type of key to
     open each particular lock.
<BR><BR>[0004]In addition to requiring a user to keep track of a key, conventional
     locks are not feasible for smaller objects where controlling access is
     also beneficial. Folders, and even medicine bottles, are examples of
     containers where using conventional locks would be cumbersome.
     Accordingly, improved locks that can be used for multiple objects, even
     small containers, and reduce the nuisance of carrying a key or memorizing
     a code are needed in the art.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE
<BR><BR>[0005]To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, the
     disclosure provides a cryptographic lock for securing an asset. In one
     embodiment, the cryptographic lock includes: (1) a shape memory alloy
     (SMA) having a first and second phase, wherein the first phase inhibits
     access to an asset and the second phase allows access to the asset and
     (2) a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transponder, coupled to the
     SMA, configured to receive an authentication signal from an RFID
     transceiver and, based thereon, energize the SMA to temporarily change
     the SMA from the first phase to the second phase.
<BR><BR>[0006]In another aspect, the disclosure provides a method of operating a
     cryptographic lock having at least one SMA. In one embodiment, the method
     includes: (1) receiving a first RF signal, (2) determining the first RF
     signal includes a first designated key and (3) energizing, if the first
     radio frequency (RF) signal includes the first designated key, a first
     SMA to change the first SMA from a first phase to a second phase, the
     first phase inhibiting access to an asset and the second phase allowing
     access to the asset.
<BR><BR>[0007]In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides a secure container.
     In one embodiment, the secure container includes: (1) a body having a
     cavity, (2) a lid configured to engage the body and cover at least a
     portion of the cavity and (3) a cryptographic lock associated with one of
     the body and the lid. The cryptographic lock includes: (3A) an SMA
     capable of assuming an Austenite phase and a Martensite phase, one of the
     Austenite phase and the Martensite phase being a first phase and another
     of the Austenite phase and the Martensite phase being a second phase, the
     first phase inhibiting the lid from uncovering the cavity, the second
     phase allowing the lid to be displaced to uncover the cavity and (3B) an
     RFID transponder, coupled to the SMA, configured to receive an
     authentication signal from an RFID transceiver and, based thereon,
     energize the SMA and thereby temporarily cause the SMA to change from the
     first phase to the second phase.
<BR><BR>[0008]In still another aspect, the disclosure provides another
     cryptographic lock. One embodiment of this cryptographic lock includes a
     first latch configured to inhibit access to an asset when in a locked
     position and allow access to the asset when in an unlocked position,
     wherein the first latch is configured to temporarily change from the
     locked position to the unlocked position in response to receipt of an RF
     signal at a first frequency.
<BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR>[0009]For a more complete understanding of the invention, reference is now
     made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the
     accompanying drawings, in which:
<BR><BR>[0010]FIG. 1 is an illustration of a side view of an embodiment of a
     secure container constructed according to the principles of the present
     disclosure;
<BR><BR>[0011]FIG. 2 is an illustration of a block diagram of an embodiment of a
     cryptographic lock constructed according to the principles of the present
     disclosure; and
<BR><BR>[0012]FIG. 3 is an illustration of a flow diagram of an embodiment of a
     method of operating a cryptographic lock carried out according to the
     principles of the present disclosure.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>[0013]The present disclosure provides a cryptographic lock that uses an RF
     transceiver to provide the key to allow access to assets. In one
     embodiment, the cryptographic lock includes at least one SMA circuit
     integrated with an RFID transponder. Energy generated by the RFID
     transponder causes a change between Martensite and Austenite phases of
     the SMA to unlock the cryptographic locks and allow access to assets. The
     RFID transponder generates the energy upon receipt of an authentication
     signal from an RFID transceiver which, for example, may be integrated
     within a mobile telephone.
<BR><BR>[0014]Multiple SMA circuits may be used to inhibit access to an access. As
     such, a different frequency may be employed to provide the appropriate
     signal for energizing each of the SMA circuits to change from one phase
     to another phase. Thus, a combination lock may be used that requires
     multiple frequencies to unlock. In some embodiments, instead of an SMA
     circuit, a solenoid may be used. In embodiments with multiple solenoids,
     each of the solenoids can operate at a different frequency to move the
     corresponding cores of the solenoids from a locked position to an
     unlocked position to allow access.
<BR><BR>[0015]The cryptographic lock disclosed herein does not require a user to
     remember a code or carry a key. Instead, a user can use an RF transceiver
     to transmit a signal including key to operate the lock. A cellular
     telephone can be used as the RF transceiver. Additionally, unlike
     alternative locks which are typically larger, the cryptographic lock can
     be positioned out of view but still function. As such, the cryptographic
     lock can be used to discretely secure assets.
<BR><BR>[0016]In addition to preventing access, the cryptographic lock can also be
     used to monitor access to an asset. A log can be used to track when the
     lock has been opened. Thus, a user can review the log, such as via a
     mobile telephone, and determine at what times the lock was opened. These
     times can then be compared to known times of access by the user to
     determine if any unauthorized assess occurred.
<BR><BR>[0017]The disclosed cryptographic lock can be used to secure various
     assets. Additionally, the cryptographic lock can be used on various
     structure or containers to secure the assets. For example, the
     cryptographic lock disclosed herein may be used to secure folders,
     laptops, suitcases, vehicles, cabinets, firearms or containers. The
     containers using the locks can vary in size and be used to store a wide
     ranging of products including medicine, alcohol, hazardous substances,
     etc. The cryptographic lock, therefore, can be used in multiple
     embodiments. Considering a medicine container, a log can be reviewed to
     indicate, for example, when a user has taken medication. Thus, the
     disclosed cryptographic lock can be used to monitor medication for a
     patient. The cryptographic lock may be integrated with an object or may
     be added to an object after manufacturing.
<BR><BR>[0018]FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of an embodiment of a secure
     container 100 constructed according to the principles of the present
     disclosure. The secure container 100 includes a body 110, a lid 120 and a
     cryptographic lock 130. The secure container 100 is configured to store
     assets in the cavity. For example, the secure container 100 may be a
     medicine container for storing medicine. Of course, the secure container
     100 is not limited to being a medicine container but may be used to store
     other products.
<BR><BR>[0019]The body 110 has a cavity wherein various products or assets may be
     stored. The lid 120 is configured to engage the body and cover at least a
     portion of the cavity. Thus, depending on the embodiment, the size of the
     body 110, the corresponding cavity and the lid 120 can vary. In some
     embodiments, the lid 120 may be sized to cover the entire opening of the
     cavity. The lid 120 is removed from the body 110 by being pulled away in
     an upward direction as illustrated. In other embodiments, the lid 120 and
     the body 110 may be coupled together via a different means. For example,
     the lid 120 and the body 110 may have corresponding threads or grooves
     that allow the lid 120 to be threadedly engaged with the body 110,
     allowing the lid 120 to be screwed on or screwed off the body 110. The
     body 110 or lid 120 may be constructed of various materials including,
     plastics, metals, woods, etc.
<BR><BR>[0020]The cryptographic lock 130 can be associated with one of the body
     110 and the lid 120 and is configured to control access to the cavity of
     the secure container 100. The cryptographic lock 130 includes a first SMA
     134, a second SMA 136 and an RFID transponder 138. The SMAs 134, 136, are
     capable of assuming an Austenite phase and a Martensite phase. Those
     skilled in the pertinent art are familiar with SMAs, their Austenite and
     Martensite phases and how they may be transitioned between the phases
     using an electric current. In the cryptographic lock 130, the SMAs 134,
     136, are configured to inhibit removing the lid 120 while in the
     Martensite phase to uncover the cavity. When in the Austenite phase, the
     SMAs 134, 136, are configured to allow the lid 120 to be displaced to
     uncover the cavity.
<BR><BR>[0021]In other embodiments, a single SMA may be used to inhibit or allow
     access to the cavity. Additionally, the SMA may be positioned differently
     to prevent access to the cavity. For example, in the secure container
     100, the top portion (both sides) of the body 110 provides a barrier to
     remove the lid 120 when the SMAs are in the Martensite phase. In another
     embodiment of a secure container, such as one with a twist cap, the SMA
     or SMAs may extend perpendicularly from a lid while in the Martensite
     phase and cooperate with a ridge of the body to inhibit access (i.e.,
     prevent the lid from being twisted-off). Of course, the cryptographic
     lock 130 may also be integrated with the body 110 instead of the lid 120.
     As such, the SMA of SMAs integrated with the body 110 would cooperate
     with a barrier or barriers located on the lid 120 to inhibit access to
     the cavity.
<BR><BR>[0022]The RFID transponder 138 is coupled to the SMAs 134, 136, and is
     configured to receive an authentication signal from an RFID transceiver
     150 and, based thereon, energize the SMAs 134, 136. The energy from the
     RFID transponder 138 temporarily causes the SMAs 134, 136, to change from
     a first phase to a second phase. The RFID transponder 138 provides
     current to the to SMAs 134, 136, to energize each SMA and, through the
     heat generated by the current, transform the SMAs 134, 136, from the
     Martensite phase and to the Austenite phase. The energy heats the SMAs
     134, 136, to a threshold temperature (A.sub.s) that is needed to change
     the SMAs 134, 136, from the Martensite phase to the Austenite phase. The
     temperature at the completion of the transformation to the Austenite
     phase is referred to as A.sub.f. The threshold and final temperatures of
     the SMA depend on the material of the SMAs 134, 136. The SMAs 134, 136,
     may be, for example, copper-zinc-aluminum-nickel, copper-aluminum-nickel,
     or nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys.
<BR><BR>[0023]The RFID transponder 138 and the RFID transceiver 150 may be
     conventional devices. The RFID transponder 138 can be a conventional RFID
     transponder that is activated upon receipt of a coded signal (i.e., the
     authentication signal) from a corresponding RFID transceiver (i.e., the
     RFID transceiver 150). The RFID transponder 138 may be a passive device
     that derives power from the received RF signal from the RF transceiver
     150. In other embodiments, the RF transponder 138 may be a
     battery-powered device. The RFID transponder 138 may be RFID tag
     including a microchip combined with an antenna. The antenna receives a
     signal from an RFID reader or scanner, such as the authentication signal
     from the RFID transceiver 150, and returns the signal. The return signal
     to the RFID transceiver 150 can include additional data such as the
     access times. Thus, unlike conventional locks, the cryptographic lock 130
     can be used to log when the secure container 100 was opened. A user can
     then view the log via the RFID transceiver 150 to determine tampering.
<BR><BR>[0024]The RFID transponder 138 and the RFID transceiver 150 may
     communicate via Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology. NFC between
     the RFID transponder 138 and the RFID transceiver is enabled by bringing
     the two NFC compatible devices, the RFID transponder 138 and the RFID
     transceiver 150, close to one another, typically less than four
     centimeters apart. Bluetooth.TM. is an example of a NFC technology. At
     the contact distance between the RFID transponder 138 and the RFID
     transceiver 150 (i.e., distance between the devices where NFC occurs),
     the amount of energy that may be captured or redirected by the RFID
     transponder 138 is or about 1.8 mA at 2 V. The SMAs 134, 136, can be
     sized to achieve the threshold temperature A.sub.s when the energy is
     received.
<BR><BR>[0025]FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of a
     cryptographic lock 200 constructed according to the principles of the
     present disclosure. The cryptographic lock 200 includes a base 210 and
     multiple latches 220, 230 and 240. In FIG. 1, the cryptographic lock 130
     is integrated with the lid 120. In FIG. 2, the cryptographic lock 200 is
     positioned on a base 210 that allows the cryptographic lock 200 to be
     added to a container, a cabinet, closet, door, etc., after manufacturing
     thereof. A glue or mechanical fixture may be used to secure the base to
     the object to be secured. The size of the cryptographic lock 200 can vary
     depending on the intended use. The cryptographic lock 200 can be
     positioned out of view to provide security without providing an eyesore.
     In some embodiments, the cryptographic lock 200 may be used as an
     actuator to operate a larger bolt to inhibit access.
<BR><BR>[0026]At least one of the latches 220, 230, 240, may be a SMA that is
     sufficiently energized by an RF frequency to create current through each
     of the latches 220, 230, 240, to change each latch from a locked position
     (e.g., Martensite phase) to an unlocked position (e.g., Austenite phase).
     In another embodiment, at least one of the latches 220, 230, 240, may be
     a solenoid that operates at an RF frequency to convert the RF energy to
     linear motion that moves the solenoid core from a locked position to an
     unlocked position. In some embodiments, each latch 220, 230, 240, may be
     tuned to be energized by the same RF frequency. In other embodiments,
     each latch 220, 230, 240, may be energized by a different RF frequency.
     In such an embodiment, an RF transceiver (or RF transceivers) capable of
     transmitting multiple RF frequencies is needed to allow a user to open
     the cryptographic lock 200.
<BR><BR>[0027]As illustrated in FIG. 2, the cryptographic lock 200 may include
     RFID transponders 250, 260, 270. The RFID transponders 250, 260, 270, can
     be used to provide current to each of the latches 220, 230, 240,
     respectively. The RFID transponders 250, 260, 270, may operate as the
     RFID transponder 138 previous discussed with respect to FIG. 1. Each RFID
     transponder 250, 260, 270, may operate at a different frequency.
     Alternatively, the same RF frequency may be used for each of the
     transponders 250, 260, 270.
<BR><BR>[0028]FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of an embodiment of a method 300
     of operating a cryptographic lock carried out according to the principles
     of the present disclosure. The cryptographic lock may include at least
     one SMA component and an RFID transponder. The method 300 begins with an
     intent to operate the cryptographic lock in a step 305.
<BR><BR>[0029]The method 300 continues in a step 310 by receiving an RF signal.
     The RF signal may be received from a mobile telephone having an RFID
     transceiver. The RF signal may be transmitted by the mobile telephone
     employing NFC technology. In one embodiment, a Bluetooth.TM. compliant
     transmission may be used to communicate the signal.
<BR><BR>[0030]After receiving the RF signal, a determination is made if the RF
     signal includes a designated key in a decisional step 320. If the RF
     signal includes the designated key, the SMA component is energized
     sufficiently to change the SMA from a first phase to a second phase in a
     step 330. The SMA can be coupled to the RF transponder such that the SMA
     is sufficiently energized during normal operation of the RF transponder.
     By being sufficiently energized, the SMA receives enough energy to
     transform the SMA from the first phase (e.g., Martensite) to the second
     phase (e.g., Austenite). The first phase prevents access to an asset and
     the second phase allows access to the asset.
<BR><BR>[0031]After the SMA is transformed from the first phase to the second
     phase, the asset protected by the cryptographic lock can now be accessed
     in a step 340. Transformation between phases allows the SMA to go from a
     locked position to an unlocked position. As such, a lid can be removed to
     allow access to a secured product. Alternatively, a door can now be
     opened to allow access. After obtaining access, the RF signal with the
     designated key may be needed to re-secure the access. In other words,
     after a particular amount of time, depending on the SMA, the SMA will
     transform back to the first phase from the second phase. As such, the SMA
     will need to be energized to replace the lid or close the door to again
     secure the asset. The method then ends in a step 350.
<BR><BR>[0032]Returning now to decisional step 320, if the RF signal does not
     include the designated key, then the method 300 returns to step 310 and
     continues. The method 300 may repeat if there are multiple SMAs used to
     inhibit access to property with each SMA operating at a different RF
     frequency.
<BR><BR>[0033]The disclosure provides a micromechanical locking mechanism that
     uses an RFID tag (including passive or active high- or
     ultrahigh-frequency, HF or UHF) which requires an <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B>
     to be passed before energizing a latch, such as an SMA. The current
     traversing the SMA wire from the RFID tag elevates the temperature of the
     SMA causing it to change phases. The change from one phase to the other
     phase results in a change of shape of the SMA that unlocks the lock and
     enables access to an asset for a brief period of time after the source of
     energy (i.e., the RF signal with the <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B>) is removed.
<BR><BR>[0034]The disclosed cryptographic lock can be embodied with no other
     mechanical parts and can be manufactured to function in small spaces. The
     lock may take the form of a completely passive system using the field
     energy from the RF signal to power the SMA.
<BR><BR>[0035]The disclosed cryptographic lock also allows the RF transceiver and
     the RF transponder to maintain a log of each entry. The owner of the lock
     can query the lock to ensure there were no unauthorized entries.
     Additionally, the owner can view the RF transceiver, for example a cell
     telephone, to determine when the RF transceiver was used to open the
     lock. The disclosed cryptographic lock can then be used for medication
     monitoring and alerts since the RF transceiver would be needed to scan
     the medication container to obtain access.
<BR><BR>[0036]With the cryptographic lock integrated in the lid or body of a
     container, the lock can also be used to ensure no tampering with the
     substance occurred throughout the supply chain. Additionally, the lock
     can ensure the substance within the container is the same substance that
     the manufacturer put inside. Thus, the lock can also protect against
     counterfeit pharmaceuticals or controlled substances being injected into
     a supply chain by, for example, preventing a vial or container from being
     opened without proper authentication.
<BR><BR>[0037]Those skilled in the art to which the invention relates will
     appreciate that other and further additions, deletions, substitutions and
     modifications may be made to the described embodiments without departing
     from the scope of the invention.
