This was during the artist\'s Rose Period, when he changed his painting style from the downbeat tones of his Blue Period to warmer and more romantic hues. The painting currently resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was donated to the museum in 1952 by automobile heiress Thelma Chrysler Foy, daughter of Walter Chrysler, the founder of the Chrysler automobile company.

The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d\'Avinyó (Avinyó Street) in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso\'s native Spain, giving them a savage aura. In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. The work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art. Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to wide anger and disagreement, even amongst his closest associates and friends.\r\nPainted in Paris during the summer of 1907, Picasso had created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work. He long acknowledged the importance of Spanish art and Iberian sculpture as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the art of Oceania, although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the Musée d\'Ethnographie du Trocadéro (known today as Musée de l\'Homme) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and was unconsciously influenced by African and Tribal art several months before completing Demoiselles. Some critics argue that the painting was a reaction to Henri Matisse\'s Le bonheur de vivre and Blue Nude.', 1907, 'Cubism', 244, 234, 69, 839, 1, 8, '2016-01-29 23:36:06'),

It was the beginning of collage materials being introduced as an important ingredient of fine art work.\r\n\r\nConsidered the first work of this new style was Pablo Picasso\'s <em>Still Life with Chair-caning</em> (1911–1912) which includes oil cloth that was printed to look like chair-caning pasted onto an oval canvas, with text; and rope framing the whole picture. At the upper left are the letters \"JOU\", which appear in many cubist paintings and refer to the newspaper titled Le Journal. Newspaper clippings were a common inclusion, physical pieces of newspaper, sheet music, and like items were also included in the collages. JOU may also at the same time be a pun on the French words jeu (game) or jouer (to play).

(35, 'Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres', '35.jpg', 'La Grande Odalisque', '<em>Grande Odalisque</em>, also known as Une Odalisque or La Grande Odalisque, is an oil painting of 1814 by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres depicting an odalisque, or concubine. Ingres\' contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres\' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism.\r\nGrande Odalisque attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It has been especially noted for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is housed in the Louvre, Paris.\r\nThis eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had \"neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation\".[3] This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism.[4] Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be criticized for his work until the mid-1820s.', 1814, 'Romanticism', 89, 163, 125, 107, 1, 22, '2016-02-19 10:47:17'),
(36, 'Eugene Delacroix', '36.jpg', 'Liberty Leading the People', '<em>Liberty Leading the People</em> (French: La Liberté guidant le peuple) is a painting by Eugène Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, which toppled Charles X of France. A woman personifying Liberty leads the people forward over the bodies of the fallen, holding the tricolore flag of the French Revolution in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The painting is perhaps Delacroix\'s best-known work.\r\nDelacroix depicted Liberty, as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people, an approach that contemporary critics denounced as \"ignoble\". The mound of corpses acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789-94. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the romantic era.\r\nThe fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols (who may have been the inspiration for the character Gavroche in Victor Hugo\'s Les Misérables). What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes.

People who attended the funeral were the models for the painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives, but in <em>Burial</em> Courbet said he \"painted the very people who had been present at the interment, all the townspeople\". The result is a realistic presentation of them, and of life in Ornans.\r\nThe vast painting—it measures 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters)—drew both praise and fierce denunciations from critics and the public, in part because it upset convention by depicting a prosaic ritual on a scale which previously would have been reserved for a religious or royal subject.', 1849, 'Realism', 314, 663, 145, 50, 1, NULL, '2016-05-02 00:44:53'),
(39, 'Edouard Manet', '39.jpg', 'Bar at the Folies Bergere', '<em>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère</em> (French: Un bar aux Folies Bergère), painted and exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1882, was the last major work by French painter Édouard Manet. It depicts a scene in the Folies Bergère nightclub in Paris.\r\nThe painting is filled with contemporaneous details specific to the Folies-Bergère. The distant pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner belong to a trapeze artist, who is performing above the restaurant\'s patrons.\r\nThe beer which is depicted, Bass Pale Ale (noted by the red triangle on the label), would have catered not to the tastes of Parisians, but to those of English tourists, suggesting a British clientele. Manet has signed his name on the label of the bottle at the bottom left, combining the centuries-old practice of self-promotion in art with something more modern, bordering on the product placement concept of the late twentieth century. One interpretation of the painting has been that far from only being a seller of the wares shown on the counter, the woman is herself one of the wares for sale; conveying undertones of prostitution. The man in the background may be a potential client.\r\nBut for all its specificity to time and place, it is worth noting that, should the background of this painting indeed be a reflection in a mirror on the wall behind the bar as suggested by some critics, the woman in the reflection would appear directly behind the image of the woman facing forward. Neither are the bottles reflected accurately or in like quantity for it to be a reflection. These details were criticized in the French press when the painting was shown. The assumption is faulty when one considers that the postures of the two women, however, are quite different and the presence of the man to whom the second woman speaks marks the depth of the subject area. Indeed many critics view the faults in the reflection to be fundamental to the painting as they show a double reality and meaning to the work. One interpretation is that the reflection is an interaction earlier in time that results in the subject\'s expression in the painting\'s present.', 1882, 'Impressionism', 96, 130, 125, 300, 1, NULL, '2016-05-22 09:26:20'),

In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat.

As with the Paris Opera, the spectacle of the turf gave Degas the base material from which to forge images of modern life in an alloy that fused references to the art of the past with details observed from life and scrupulously documented. But more than any other of his subjects, this was a genre that fed upon itself and spawned countless variations and adjustments. From a repertory established very early, Degas proceeded to select individual jockeys and rearrange them, to repeat poses and refine them, until this hermetic world lost all connection with the reality of the race track...\r\n\r\nThis diminutive composition of Race Horses, which falls toward the end of the first phase in this development, is immediately distinguished by its unusual support.

His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal.
