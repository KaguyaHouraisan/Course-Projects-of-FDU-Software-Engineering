<BR><BR>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<BR><BR>[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent
     application Ser. No. 09/927,742 entitled "FLEXIBLE LOYALTY POINTS
     PROGRAMS," filed Aug. 10, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference
     in its entirety for all purposes.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002] This invention relates to game playing methods for gaming machines,
     such as video slot machines and video poker machines, or for tracked
     table games. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods
     and apparatus of allowing game players to participate in loyalty programs
     on gaming machines and during other gaming activities.
<BR><BR>[0003] As technology in the gaming industry progresses, the traditional
     mechanically driven reel slot machines are being replaced or supplemented
     with electronic counterparts having CRT, LCD video displays or the like
     and gaming machines such as video slot machines and video poker machines
     are becoming increasingly popular. Part of the reason for their increased
     popularity is the nearly endless variety of games that can be implemented
     on gaming machines utilizing advanced electronic technology. In some
     cases, newer gaming machines are utilizing computing architectures
     developed for personal computers. These video/electronic gaming
     advancements enable the operation of more complex games, which would not
     otherwise be possible on mechanical-driven gaming machines and allow the
     capabilities of the gaming machine to evolve with advances in the
     personal computing industry.
<BR><BR>[0004] Typically, utilizing a master gaming controller, the gaming machine
     controls various combinations of devices that allow a player to play a
     game on the gaming machine and also encourage game play on the gaming
     machine. For example, a game played on a gaming machine usually requires
     a player to input money or indicia of credit into the gaming machine,
     indicate a wager amount, and initiate a game play. These steps require
     the gaming machine to control input devices, including bill validators
     and coin acceptors, to accept money into the gaming machine and recognize
     user inputs from devices, including touch screens and button pads, to
     determine the wager amount and initiate game play.
<BR><BR>[0005] After game play has been initiated, the gaming machine determines a
     game outcome, presents the game outcome to the player and may dispense an
     award of some type depending on the outcome of the game. A game outcome
     presentation may utilize many different visual and audio components such
     as flashing lights, music, sounds and graphics. The visual and audio
     components of the game outcome presentation may be used to draw a players
     attention to various game features and to heighten the players interest
     in additional game play. Maintaining a game player's interest in game
     play, such as on a gaming machine or during other gaming activities, is
     an important consideration for an operator of a gaming establishment.
<BR><BR>[0006] One related method of gaining and maintaining a game player's
     interest in game play is loyalty point programs, such as player tracking
     programs, offered at various casinos. Loyalty point programs provide
     rewards to players that typically correspond to the player's level of
     patronage (e.g., to the player's playing frequency and/or total amount of
     game plays at a given casino). Loyalty point rewards may be free meals,
     free lodging and/or free entertainment. These rewards may help to sustain
     a game player's interest in additional game play during a visit to a
     gaming establishment and may entice a player to visit a gaming
     establishment to partake in various gaming activities.
<BR><BR>[0007] In general, loyalty programs may be applied to any game of chance
     offered at a gaming establishment. An example of a hardware and/or
     software implementation of a loyalty reward program with respect to a
     number of gaming machines is described as follows. FIG. 1 is a block
     diagram of a number of gaming machines with player tracking units
     connected to servers providing player tracking services. In casino 150,
     gaming machines 100, 101, 102 and 103 are connected, via the data
     collection unit (DCU) to the player tracking/accounting server 120. The
     DCU 106, which may be connected to up to 32 player tracking units in a
     particular example, consolidates the information gathered from player
     tracking units in communication with the DCU 106 and forwards the
     information to a player tracking account server such as 120.
<BR><BR>[0008] In another casino 151, a different player tracking server 121 is
     connected to gaming machines 130 and 131. In yet another casino 152, a
     separate player tracking server 122 is connected to gaming machines 132
     and 133.
<BR><BR>[0009] In gaming machine 100 of casino 150, a player tracking unit 107 and
     slot machine interface board (SMIB) 103 are mounted within a main cabinet
     8 of the gaming machine. A top box 130 is mounted on top of the main
     cabinet 8 of the gaming machine. In many types of gaming machines, the
     player tracking unit is mounted within the top box 130. Usually, player
     tracking units, such as 107, and SMIBs, such as 103, are manufactured as
     separate units before installation into a gaming machine. The player
     tracking unit 107 includes three player tracking devices, a card reader
     24, a key pad 22, and a display 16, all mounted within the unit.
<BR><BR>[0010] The player tracking unit 107 communicates with the player tracking
     server via the SMIB 103, a main communication board 110 and the data
     collection unit 106. The player tracking unit 107 is usually connected to
     the master gaming controller 104 via a serial connection of some type and
     communicates with the master gaming controller 104 using a communication
     protocol of some type. For example, the master gaming controller 104 may
     employ a subset of the Slot Accounting System (SAS protocol) developed by
     International Game Technology of Reno, Nev. to communicate with the
     player tracking unit 107.
<BR><BR>[0011] Typically, when a game player wants to play a game on a gaming
     machine and utilize the player tracking services available through the
     player tracking unit, a game player inserts a player tracking card, such
     as a magnetic striped card, into the card reader 24. After the magnetic
     striped card has been so inserted, the player tracking unit 107 may
     detect this event and receive certain identification information
     contained on the card. For example, a player's name, address, and player
     tracking account number encoded on the magnetic striped card, may be
     received by the player tracking unit 107. In general, a player must
     provide identification information of some type to utilize player
     tracking services available on a gaming machine. For current player
     tracking programs, the most common approach for providing identification
     information is to issue a magnetic-striped card storing the necessary
     identification information to each player that wishes to participate in a
     given player tracking program.
<BR><BR>[0012] After a player has inserted her or his player tracking card into
     the card reader 24, the player tracking unit 107 may command the display
     16 to display the game player's name on the display 16 and also, may
     optionally display a message requesting the game player to validate their
     identity by entering an identification code using the key pad 22. Once
     the game player's identity has been validated, the player tracking
     information is relayed to the player tracking server 120. Typically, the
     player tracking server 120 stores player tracking account records
     including the number of player tracking points previously accumulated by
     the player.
<BR><BR>[0013] During game play on the gaming machine, the player tracking unit
     120 may poll the master gaming controller 104 for game play information
     such as how much money the player has wagered on each game, the time when
     each game was initiated and the location of the gaming machine. The game
     play information is sent by the player tracking unit 107 to the player
     tracking server 120. While a player tracking card is inserted in the card
     reader 24, the player tracking server 120 may use the game play
     information provided by the player tracking unit 107 to generate player
     tracking points and add the points to a player tracking account
     identified by the player tracking card. The player tracking points
     generated by the player tracking server 120 are stored in a memory of
     some type on the player tracking server.
<BR><BR>[0014] As suggested above, a player's incentive for using the player
     tracking services is awards provided by the gaming machine operator
     (e.g., the casino). Unfortunately, when player tracking identification
     information is not provided to the player tracking server 120 via the
     player tracking unit 107, player tracking points are not accrued for a
     game player participating in a game play session on gaming machine 100.
     For example, when a player tracking card is not inserted into the card
     reader 24, the player tracking card has been inserted incorrectly or the
     card reader is malfunctioning, a game player may not obtain player
     tracking points while participating in game play on gaming machine 100.
     This happens more frequently than one might imagine. Very often a player
     will forget to bring his/her playing card to a casino, or leave the card
     in his/her room, or possibly return from the swimming pool without a card
     and decide to play anyway.
<BR><BR>[0015] Also, when the player uses a player tracking card that is
     incompatible with gaming machine 100, such as a player tracking card
     issued at another casino, player tracking points are not awarded to the
     player. Typically, each casino implements a player tracking program with
     player tracking cards that may only be used to earn player tracking
     points only at the casino where the card was issued. For instance, casino
     150 may issue a player tracking card that is only valid at casino 150,
     casino 151 may issue a player tracking card that is only valid at casino
     151, and casino 152 may issue a player tracking card that is only valid
     at casino 152. In this example, the player may be a member of the player
     tracking programs available at each of casinos 150, 151 and 152. Thus,
     when a player tries to use the card issued at casino 151 in casino 150 or
     in casino 152, the card will not work and the player will not earn player
     tracking points.
<BR><BR>[0016] In many gaming establishments, loyalty programs that allow a player
     to earn "complimentaries" or "comps", such as free rooms/buffets/shows
     etc., during table game play are very common. A player may earn "comps"
     for playing table games, such as black jack, baccarat, pai gow poker,
     keno and roulette. Depending on the gaming establishment, a loyalty
     program based upon table game play may or may not be combined with a
     loyalty program based upon slot game play.
<BR><BR>[0017] Comps at table games are awarded using a rating system. To get
     rated, a player must give their name to a casino service representative
     every time they sit down to play a table game. The player must supply
     their name even if they have only moved from one table to an adjacent
     table. During the player's game play at the table, a casino service
     representative, such as a pit boss, keeps track of, or rates, the player.
     This means that the casino service person writes down how much a player
     buys in for, what his average bet is, how fast they play, how long they
     play and how much they win or lose. When the player leaves the table
     their rating is handed in. The game play information from their table
     gaming session is entered into a computer usually connected a remote
     server that stores a record of the player's game playing history. If the
     player then asks for dinner for two at the coffee shop the pit boss can
     look up their game play history and, based on guidelines, which may vary
     from casino to casino, decide whether or not a comp is justified. When a
     comp is justified, the pit boss can offer the player a voucher valid for
     the requested comp.
<BR><BR>[0018] Player tracking/comp cards and player tracking/comp programs are
     becoming more and more popular. They have become a de facto method of
     doing business at casinos. A player may belong to many different player
     tracking/comp programs and have many different player tracking cards
     corresponding to each program to which they belong. For example, a single
     player may belong to as many as 20-30 separate player tracking programs
     and have 20-30 player tracking cards. As indicated, a disadvantage of
     current player tracking programs using player tracking cards is that a
     game player may simply forget to bring her card, lose her card, bring the
     wrong card, or forget to insert it into the gaming machine. In each of
     these cases, the player will fail to earn player tracking points. The
     casino is deprived of valuable marketing information and loyalty
     incentive and the player is deprived of awards that would otherwise be
     provided.
<BR><BR>[0019] In view of the above, it would be desirable to provide apparatus
     and methods for player tracking programs that eliminate factors that can
     prevent the initiation of a player tracking session on a gaming machine.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0020] This invention addresses the needs indicated above by providing a
     gaming machine that includes an input mechanism with a non-physical
     contact data interface. The non-physical contact data interface may be

<BR><BR>[0023] The loyalty program instrument may be selected from the group
     consisting of an RFID tag, a portable wireless device, a cell phone, a
     portable computation device and a portable communication device. In
     addition, the loyalty program instrument may be a substrate including at
     least one of a 1-D bar-code printed on the substrate, a 2-D bar-code
     printed on the substrate, a symbol printed on the substrate, an
     alpha-numeric character printed on the substrate, a Radio Frequency
     Identification (RFID) tag embedded in the substrate, an RFID tag printed
     on the substrate and combinations thereof. The substrate may include a
     top-side and a bottom-side where the loyalty program instrument data may
     be printed on the top-side and the bottom-side and where the non-physical
     contact data interface is operable to read the loyalty program instrument
     from at least one of the top-side, the bottom-side and combinations
     thereof. The loyalty program instrument data printed on the top-side and
     the bottom-side may be the same.
<BR><BR>[0024] The loyalty program instrument may comprise a substrate with an
     adhesive backing where substrate with the adhesive backing may be
     attached to an item worn or carried by a game player that uses the gaming
     machine. The substrate with the adhesive backing may be one of a
     printable media and may include an embedded RFID tag. The gaming machine
     may include an output mechanism, such as a printer, for issuing one or
     more of the loyalty program instruments with the adhesive backing. The
     substrate may be attached to a curved surface. Thus, the non-physical
     contact data interface may be operable to read data from curved surfaces.
<BR><BR>[0025] In particular embodiments, the non-physical contact data interface
     may be operable to read the loyalty program instrument data from the
     loyalty program instrument for: 1) the loyalty program instrument in a
     fixed position relative to the non-physical contact data interface during
     the reading of data from the loyalty program instrument data, 2) the
     loyalty program instrument in a time varying orientation relative to the
     non-physical contact data interface during the reading of data from the
     loyalty program instrument data, 3) for the loyalty program instrument in
     a time varying distance relative to the non-physical contact data
     interface during the reading of data from the loyalty program instrument
     data, 4) the loyalty program instrument in a plurality of distances
     relative to the non-physical contact data interface and 5) the loyalty
     program instrument in a plurality of orientations relative to the
     non-physical contact data interface.
<BR><BR>[0026] On the gaming machine, one or more physical guides may be provided
     for aligning the loyalty program instrument relative to the non-physical
     contact data interface. Further, the gaming machine may include a housing
     mounted within an interior of the gaming machine. The housing may
     comprise: a front surface including an opening allowing the loyalty
     program instrument to be inserted into the gaming machine and to removed
     from the gaming machine where the front surface of the housing is part of
     an exterior of surface of the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0027] The gaming machine may comprise a sound projection device for
     emitting a sound in response to a data read by the non-physical contact
     data interface or a lighting device for generating light in response to a
     data read by the non-physical contact data interface. The lighting device
     may change color in response to a data read by the non-physical contact
     data interface. For example, the lighting device may generate one of a
     first color, first light pattern and combinations thereof when a status
     of the loyalty program session is active and may generate one of a second
     color, a second light pattern and combinations thereof when the status of
     the loyalty program session is inactive. Further, the lighting device may
     generate one of a third color, a third light pattern and combinations
     thereof when the status of the loyalty program session is about to
     change.
<BR><BR>[0028] In a further embodiment, the lighting device and the sound
     projection device may be incorporated into a loyalty program session
     status interface. The loyalty program session status interface may
     generate one of a sound, a light pattern, a light color and combinations
     thereof when data is read correctly by the non-physical contact data
     interface and may generate one of a sound, a light pattern, a light color
     and combinations thereof when data is read incorrectly by the
     non-physical contact data interface. The loyalty program session status
     interface may generate one of a sound, a light pattern, a light color and
     combinations thereof when a status of the loyalty program session is
     active, may generate one of a sound, a light pattern, a light color and
     combinations thereof when a status of the loyalty program session is
     inactive and may generate one of a sound, a light pattern, a light color
     and combinations thereof when a status of the loyalty program session is
     about to change.
<BR><BR>[0029] In a particular embodiment, the input mechanism may be a bar-code
     reader and the non-physical contact data interface may be a scanner. The
     scanner may be one of a laser scanner and a charge coupled device
     scanner. The scanner may be capable of 1) reading data printed in a
     non-visible format and 2) reading loyalty program instrument data that is
     encoded in one of a 1-D bar-code, a 2-D bar-code, a symbol, alpha-numeric
     characters and combinations thereof. The encoded loyalty program data may
     be encrypted and may be one of a) loyalty program information, b)
     biometric information, c) player preferences, d) promotional information,
     e) gaming machine configuration settings, f) prize information, g)
     cashless transaction information and h) and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0030] The bar-code reader may further comprise 1) a logic device designed
     or configured for i) parsing data, ii) performing format conversion, iii)
     performing optical character recognition, iv) performing encryption and
     v) combinations thereof and 2) a communication interface for transmitting
     information to the master gaming controller, a processor located in a
     player tracking unit and combinations thereof. In a particular
     embodiment, the scanner may be mounted below a translucent substrate on
     an exterior surface of the gaming machine where the scanner may be
     designed to read loyalty program instrument data stored on the loyalty
     program instrument when the loyalty program instrument is placed within a
     volume of space above the translucent substrate. In another embodiment,
     the scanner may be mounted below a card slot on the gaming machine where
     the scanner is designed to read loyalty program instrument data stored on
     the loyalty program instrument when the loyalty program instrument is
     placed in the card slot.
<BR><BR>[0031] In yet another embodiment, the input mechanism is a Radio Frequency
     (RFID) reader and the non-physical contact data interface is an antenna
     capable of reading loyalty program instrument data stored on an RFID tag.
     The RFID tag may be an inductively coupled RFID tag or a capacitively
     coupled RFID tag. The RFID tag may comprise one of 1) a logic device, 2)
     a power source, 3) a non-volatile memory, 4) a read-only memory, 5) a
     random access memory, 6) an antenna and 7) combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0032] The RFID tag may be capable of storing an index to a record in a
     loyalty program database, a record of data in a loyalty program database
     and combinations thereof. The stored data may be encrypted and may be one
     of 1) loyalty program information, 2) biometric information, 3) player
     preferences, 4) promotional information, 5) gaming machine configuration
     settings, 6) prize information, 7) cashless transaction information and
     8) and combinations thereof. The RFID reader may be designed to program
     the RFID tag with data. The programmed data may be read by RFID tag
     readers.
<BR><BR>[0033] The gaming machine may also comprise a printer capable of printing
     loyalty program instrument data to a loyalty program instrument. The
     printer may be selected from the group consisting of a thermal contact
     printer, an inkjet print and a laser printer. The printer may be capable
     of printing loyalty program instrument data in at least one of a 1-D
     bar-code format, a 2-D bar-code format and combinations thereof. Further,
     the printer may be capable of printing in a format that is invisible,
     such as using an invisible ink.
<BR><BR>[0034] In a particular embodiment, the printer may be capable of
     generating an electronic circuit on a printable media used as a loyalty
     program instrument. The printable media may be flexible. The electronic
     circuit may be programmed to store loyalty instrument data. The
     electronic circuit may be part of an RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0035] When a magnetic striped card is used in a player tracking session,
     which is one type of loyalty program session, the session is initiated
     when physical contact between the magnetic stripe and magnetic reader is
     detected. In the present invention, the loyalty program session may be
     initiated without physical contact between the loyalty program instrument
     and the instrument reader in response to a number of conditions. For
     example, the loyalty program session may be initiated by a first gaming
     event and may be terminated by a second gaming event. The first gaming
     event may be one of i) an input of loyalty program instrument data from
     the loyalty point instrument via the non-physical contact data interface,
     ii) a deposit of an indicia of credit into the gaming machine, iii) an
     insertion of a card into a card slot on the gaming machine, iv) an
     activation an input button on the gaming machine, v) an input of a
     loyalty program instrument into the input mechanism on the gaming
     machine, vi) an input of a code into the gaming machine, vii) an input of
     biometric information into the gaming machine and viii) combinations
     thereof. The second gaming event may be one of a) an occurrence of zero
     credits on the gaming machine, b) an amount of idle time on the gaming
     machine exceeding a specified limit, c) a tilt condition, d) an error
     condition, e) a request for a loyalty program instrument, f) a request to
     terminate the loyalty program session, g) an inability to detect the
     loyalty program instrument, h) a cashout request, i) a timeout condition,
     j) an inability to detect a user of the gaming machine and k)
     combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0036] Another aspect of the present invention provides a gaming system
     for communicating and locating wireless gaming devices. The gaming system
     may be generally characterized as comprising: 1) a plurality of wireless
     gaming device capable of generating wireless signals, 2) a plurality of
     wireless signal receivers capable of receiving signals generated by the
     wireless gaming devices where a portion of the wireless signal receivers
     are located in gaming machines; and 3) a location server for determining
     a location one or more of the wireless gaming devices and for tracking a
     status of the plurality of wireless gaming devices. The gaming system may
     be located in a casino where the gaming machines are used to generate
     games of chance. Activities on the gaming machines may be used to
     accumulate loyalty points in a loyalty program session where the wireless
     gaming devices are used provide loyalty program data used in the loyalty
     program session.
<BR><BR>[0037] In the gaming system, the location of the wireless gaming device
     may be determined using signal triangulation. The signal triangulation
     may be based upon one of a single strength, a time for a signal to travel
     and return from a wireless access point to a wireless gaming device and
     combinations thereof. The location determined for the wireless gaming
     device may be accurate to within about 1 foot or less.
<BR><BR>[0038] The location server may be used to assign a communication frequency
     for communication between a wireless signal receiver and one of the
     wireless gaming devices where the wireless gaming device may be selected
     from the group consisting of a cell phone, an RFID tag and a portable
     communication device. The wireless signal receivers may be capable of
     receiving signals simultaneously from two or more wireless gaming
     devices. In this case, the location server may be capable of determining
     which of the wireless gaming devices is closest to a selected location.
     The selected location may be directly in front of a first gaming machine
     where the wireless gaming device closest to the selected location may be
     contacted via one of the wireless access points to initiate a loyalty
     program session.
<BR><BR>[0039] Another aspect of the invention pertains to computer program
     products including a machine-readable medium on which is stored program
     instructions for implementing any of the methods described above. Any of
     the methods of this invention may be represented as program instructions
     and/or data structures, databases, etc. that can be provided on such
     computer readable media.

<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>[0054] Concepts important to many embodiments of this invention include
     "loyalty points," "loyalty point sessions," and "loyalty points
     initiation events." Loyalty points refers to any type of points accrued
     for participating in designated activities at a gaming establishment.
     Such establishments include casinos, hotels where gaming activities are
     provided, stores where gaming activities are permitted, Internet-based
     gaming activities, and the like. Designated activities include, but are
     not limited to, gaming activity such as playing gaming machines, card
     games such as black jack, pai gow poker, baccarat and poker, betting on
     public event outcomes, table games such as roulette, craps, keno and
     lotteries, etc. Other patronage activities at gaming establishments may
     accrue loyalty points. As indicated above, loyalty points represent a
     form of credit accrued for patronage. The points can be redeemed for a
     variety of goods or services (or translated to other forms of credit)
     within a gaming establishment or affiliated establishment. Player
     tracking points are a typical example of "loyalty points."
<BR><BR>[0055] Loyalty point sessions are sessions during which a person is
     performing the designated activity and during which loyalty points
     accrue. Such session may be delineated by a first event and a second
     event (such as the "game events" described above). Importantly, loyalty
     point sessions can be triggered or initiated by events that need not
     involve conventional player tracking initiation events (e.g., insertions
     of player tracking cards). Thus, the person can begin accruing loyalty
     points even if he/she forgets to insert his/her player tracking card or
     otherwise fails to initiate a conventional player tracking session.
     Further, it is possible that the entire process is performed anonymously
     so that the gaming establishment never knows who is accruing the loyalty
     points--or at least not via a conventional player tracking methodology.
<BR><BR>[0056] Because loyalty points sessions may begin without a conventional
     player tracking initiation event, a more general concept must be applied
     to initiation of loyalty points sessions. Preferably such initiation can
     be automatically detected by a gaming machine or other mechanism at a
     gaming establishment. (Note however that some activities such as black
     jack may require that a dealer or other person manually initiate the
     session.) Examples of events that trigger accrual of loyalty points
     include a player beginning to play a particular gaming machine, a player
     providing cash or indicia of credit to a gaming machine, a user actuating
     a mechanism allowing anonymous gaming activity, etc. Examples of events
     that can indicate the end of a loyalty points session include winning a
     jackpot or other conventional gaming award, a user actuating a mechanism
     indicating an end to the gaming activity, detecting that a particular
     period of inactivity has elapsed, etc.
<BR><BR>[0057] FIG. 2 is a block diagram of gaming machines 100, 101, 102 and 103
     connected to a player tracking server 120 and a loyalty program
     instrument server 200 allowing loyalty program instrument transactions.
     With the present invention, without providing a player tracking card,
     player tracking information or any other type of identification
     information, a player may initiate a game play session on gaming machine
     100, play a number of games and receive loyalty points, such as player
     tracking points. The player may or may not have a player tracking account
     with the gaming establishment such as casino 150. Note that the "game
     play session" described here serves as an example of a loyalty points
     session.
<BR><BR>[0058] For instance, the player may insert a bill or a bar-coded printed
     ticket (e.g. an EZPAY.TM. ticket) into bill validator 202 to register
     credits on the gaming machine. When credits are registered on the gaming
     machine 100, a logic device located on the gaming machine 100, such as
     master gaming controller 104 or a logic device located the player
     tracking unit 107, may begin to generate loyalty points, such as player
     tracking points. As another embodiment, when credits are registered on
     the gaming machine 100, a remote logic device such as a logic device on
     the player tracking accounting server 120 or a logic device on the
     loyalty program instrument server 200 may begin to accrue loyalty points.
     Next, the player, using input mechanisms 202, may make wagers on a number
     of games presented on the gaming machine and view the game outcomes on
     display 34. Based upon a manner in which the player participates in game
     play on the gaming machine 100, such as the amount wagered over a
     specific period of time, loyalty points may be awarded to the player. A
     rate at which the player accrues loyalty points may be adjusted according
     to the following parameters (without limitation thereto): 1) the time of
     the day, 2) the day of the week, 3) month of the year, 4) a total amount
     wagered, 5) an amount of time spent playing, 6) a game denomination, 7) a
     promotional event and 8) a game type.
<BR><BR>[0059] The amount of loyalty points awarded to the game player is
     calculated by a logic device located on the gaming machine, by a remote
     gaming device or combinations thereof. When the logic device used to
     calculate the awarded loyalty points is located remotely, the master
     gaming controller 104 may transfer certain gaming machine information,
     such as wager amounts, to the remote logic device. For instance, when the
     player tracking account server 120 or the loyalty program server 200
     calculates the amount of loyalty points awarded during a particular game
     play session, the master gaming controller 104 may send game play
     information to these remote gaming devices. In some embodiments, game
     play information used to calculate loyalty point awards may be sent from
     the gaming machine to the player tracking server 120 through the player
     tracking unit 107 or the information may be sent directly to the loyalty
     program instrument server 200. In other embodiments, the master gaming
     controller 104 may calculate the loyalty points awarded during a game
     play session. Thus, the transfer of game play information to a remote
     gaming device may not be required.
<BR><BR>[0060] At the end of the player's game play session, the amount of loyalty
     points awarded to the player may be stored on a loyalty point instrument
     such as a printed ticket, a smart card, a debit card, a room key or a
     portable wireless device. For example, the printer 201 may print a ticket
     voucher showing the amount of loyalty points awarded to the player during
     the game play session. The player may later validate the ticket to
     receive the loyalty points. As another example, loyalty points awarded to
     the player may be stored on a smart card inserted into the card reader
     24. In some embodiments, the loyalty point instrument may simply be used
     as a receipt to ensure that loyalty point credits earned by the player
     have been correctly credited to their account.
<BR><BR>[0061] When the loyalty point instrument is issued to the player, various
     types of transaction information may be recorded on the loyalty point
     instrument and may also be stored to another memory location on the
     gaming machine 100, on the loyalty program instrument server 120, on the
     player tracking server 120 or some other gaming device. Examples of
     stored transaction information includes an issue time, a date, an
     instrument number, an instrument type, a machine number, etc., The
     transaction information stored on the loyalty point instrument and stored
     at the additional memory location may be compared to validate the loyalty
     point instrument. For instance, a player may wish to have the loyalty
     points stored on the ticket voucher to be later credited to their player
     tracking account or to redeem the points directly for a goods and
     services item without crediting the player's player tracking account. In
     some cases, the player may not even have a player tracking account. To
     credit or to redeem the loyalty points stored on the loyalty point
     instrument, the transaction is first validated. Specific examples of the
     loyalty point instrument validation process and other uses of loyalty
     point instruments are described with respect to FIGS. 3-8.
<BR><BR>[0062] An advantage of loyalty point instruments of the present invention
     is that a player may earn loyalty points such as player tracking points
     from game play on a gaming machine or during other gaming activities
     without the use of a player tracking card or without providing any
     identification information. As indicated above, if a player forgets to
     bring their player tracking card, loses their player tracking card,
     brings the wrong card, forgets to insert the card into the gaming
     machine, inserts the card incorrectly into the card reader or the card
     reader is malfunctioning, the player may be still earn loyalty points
     such as player tracking points from a game play on a gaming machine. In
     current player tracking programs, before a player can receive player
     tracking points, the player must always provide identification
     information of some type, which is usually stored on their player
     tracking card. Thus, in any situation where player tracking
     identification information is not provided by the player, such as in the
     cases described above where the information is obtained from a player
     tracking card, the player does not earn player tracking points. These
     situations are avoided with the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0063] FIG. 3 is a block diagram of the components of a loyalty program
     instrument system for one embodiment of the present invention. A loyalty
     program instrument system is the hardware components and software
     components needed to generate and validate loyalty program instruments.
     Components of an loyalty program system may include 1) data acquisition
     hardware, 2) data storage hardware, 3) loyalty program instrument
     generation and validation hardware (e.g. printers, card readers, ticket
     acceptors, validation terminals, etc.), 3) auditing software, 4) loyalty
     program instrument validation software and 5) database software. Many
     types of loyalty program instrument systems are possible and are not
     limited to the components listed above. A loyalty program instrument
     system may be installed at each property utilizing loyalty program
     instruments. To allow multi-site validations of loyalty program
     instruments, the loyalty program instruments systems at each property may
     be linked to a loyalty program transaction clearinghouse. The relation of
     multiple loyalty program instrument systems connected to a loyalty
     program transaction clearinghouse are described with reference to FIGS. 4
     and 5. The details of the generation and the validation of loyalty
     program instruments using a loyalty program instrument system at one
     property are described below with reference to FIG. 3.
<BR><BR>[0064] In some embodiments of the present invention, the loyalty program
     instrument system may be implemented in conjunction with a cashless
     system that generates cashless instruments. Thus, a single instrument
     generation site may issue both cashless instruments and loyalty program
     instruments. For example, a gaming machine may issue printed tickets with
     a cash value that may be redeemed for cash or gaming credits as part of a
     cashless system or a gaming machine may issue printed tickets with a
     loyalty point value or a prize value that may be redeemed for goods and
     services as part of a loyalty program instrument system. Further, a
     single generation site may issue a plurality of different instrument
     types for cashless transaction and loyalty program transaction such as
     but not limited to smart cards, printed tickets, magnetic striped cards,
     room keys and portable wireless devices. In addition, a single validation
     site may accept and validate both cashless instruments and loyalty
     program instruments such as but not limited to smart cards, printed
     tickets, magnetic striped cards, room keys and portable wireless devices.
     An example of a cashless system that may be modified to implement both
     cashless instruments and loyalty point instruments with the present
     invention is the EZPAY.TM. system manufactured by IGT of Reno, Nev.
<BR><BR>[0065] Details of apparatus and methods used to validate a cashless
     instruments and that may be applied to the validation of a loyalty point
     instruments are described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No.

     which may applied to a loyalty program instrument system are described in
     co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/660,984 by Espin et al. filed
     Sep. 13, 2000 entitled "Transaction Signature" which is incorporated
     herein in its entirety and for all purposes.
<BR><BR>[0066] Returning to FIG. 3, a first group of gaming machines 365, 366,
     367, 368, and 369 is shown connected to a first clerk validation terminal
     (CVT) 360 and a second group of gaming machines, 375, 376, 377, 378 and
     379 is shown connected to a second CVT 370. The clerk validation
     terminals are used to store loyalty program transaction information
     generated when a loyalty program instrument is issued at a generation
     site such as a gaming machine. The loyalty program transaction
     information, which may be stored each time a loyalty program instrument
     is issued, may include but is not limited to prize information, loyalty
     point information, an establishment, a location, a bar code, a instrument
     type (e.g. ticket, smart card, room key, magnetic card, portable wireless
     device, etc.), an issue date, a validation number, an issue time, an
     instrument number, an instrument sequence number and a machine number.
     Also, the loyalty program transaction information may include transaction
     status information such as whether the loyalty program instrument has
     been validated, is outstanding or has expired. Some of the loyalty
     program transaction information stored in the CVT may also be stored on
     the loyalty program instrument as loyalty program instrument information.
     When a loyalty program instrument is validated. the information stored in
     the CVT and the information stored on the loyalty program instrument may
     be compared as a means of providing secure loyalty program transactions.
<BR><BR>[0067] As described with reference to FIG. 2, all of the gaming machines
     are designed or configured to accrue loyalty points during a game play
     session, award a player some or all of the accrued loyalty points and
     store loyalty program information to a loyalty program instrument, such
     as a printed ticket, a magnetic striped card, a room key, a portable
     wireless device or a smart card, which is issued to the game player. The
     loyalty program instruments, as part of a loyalty program available at
     property 300, may be redeemed for goods and services. In addition, the
     gaming machines and other loyalty program validation sites at property
     300 may accept loyalty program instruments issued at a different property
     from property 300 where the different property utilizes the same or a
     different loyalty program instrument system as compared to property 300.
     Details of a multi-site loyalty program instrument system are described
     with respect of FIGS. 6 and 7.
<BR><BR>[0068] A player may participate in a number of activities at the gaming
     establishment of property 300 for which the player can earn loyalty
     points. For instance, loyalty points may be earned while playing a game
     of chance at pit games 337, while playing one of the gaming machines, or
     while making a food purchase, an entertainment purchase, a transportation
     purchase, a lodging purchase, a merchandise purchase or a service
     purchase at one of the other venues 338 at property 300. Further, food
     purchases, entertainment purchases, transportation purchases, lodging
     purchases, merchandise purchases and service purchases that earn loyalty
     points for a patron may be made at venues outside of traditional gaming
     establishments but in affiliation with a gaming establishment. For
     instance, a patron may make a food purchase at a restaurant affiliated
     with a gaming establishment or may make merchandise purchase with a
     retailer affiliated with the gaming establishment. After their purchase,
     the patron may be issued a loyalty point instrument with a number of
     loyalty points that may be redeemed for goods, services and comps or may
     be later added to a loyalty point account of the patron. Affiliated
     venues that issue loyalty point instruments may be linked to a loyalty
     program server, such as 310, via the Internet (see FIG. 7).
<BR><BR>[0069] As another example, a player, without providing identification
     information such as player tracking information or comp information, may
     be identified at a pit game. After rating the players manner of game play
     over a certain period of time (e.g. amount bet), the player may be
     awarded a loyalty point instrument storing loyalty points, such as a
     printed ticket, earned during their pit game play. The loyalty point
     instrument may be later exchanged by the player for a comp, such as free
     meal at casino buffet. In another embodiment, when player comp
     information has been provided by the player, the loyalty point instrument
     may be used as a receipt that is designed to allow the player to verify
     that their game play has been both correctly rated and correctly entered
     into the comp system.
<BR><BR>[0070] After each activity, a player may be issued 1) a new loyalty
     program instrument storing the loyalty points earned for the activity or
     2) an existing loyalty program instrument may be updated to store
     additional loyalty points. For instance, the existing loyalty program
     instrument may be, a smart card, already storing loyalty points earned
     from previous activities. The smart card may be modified to store
     additional loyalty points after each new activity. Accumulated loyalty
     points earned by a player and stored on a loyalty program instrument may
     be used to obtain goods, services and comps at various loyalty program
     validation sites at property 300, such as but not limited to: i) gaming
     machines, ii) cashier stations 325, 330, 335, iii) a casino kiosk 359,
     iv) from a casino service person with a hand-held wireless device 358 and
     v) at a clerk validation terminal 360 or 370.
<BR><BR>[0071] In general user interfaces for viewing and modifying loyalty point
     accounts may be displayed on many different types of computing devices
     such as gaming machines, personal digital assistants, home computer
     linked to remote site via the Internet, a kiosk located in a casino, a
     phone and a video display interface. In one embodiment, a video display
     interface may be a television monitor located in a hotel room. The hotel
     rooms may be linked by a local intranet to the loyalty program server
     310. A touch screen, control pad or some other input device may be used
     with the television monitor to provide input to the loyalty point account
     user interface.
<BR><BR>[0072] A game player may wish to use a loyalty program instrument issued
     during one activity during another activity at property 300. For example,
     a game player may participate in a pit game 337 such as craps, roulette,
     black jack, etc. and may be issued a loyalty point instrument, such as a
     printed ticket, with a number of loyalty points based upon the manner in
     which they participated in the activity such as an amount wagered over a
     particular amount of time. Next, the player may desire to use the loyalty
     point instrument during another activity such as a game play session on
     one of the gaming machines 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 375, 376, 377, 378
     and 379. After the loyalty point instrument has been validated, as
     described below, the loyalty points stored on the loyalty point
     instrument may be used by the player to redeem prizes, goods, or services
     available on the gaming machine. In one embodiment, for promotional
     purposes, only particular prizes, goods or services may be available on
     particular gaming machines to encourage game play of those machines. In
     another embodiment, a player may redeem loyalty points stored on a
     loyalty point instrument to access a special bonus features or game play
     features on a gaming machine. For example, after the play has been issued
     a printed ticket with loyalty points during one activity, the player may
     initiate a game play session on a gaming machine by entering the printed
     ticket into a bill validator on the gaming machine. After ticket has been
     validated, as described below, some or all of the loyalty points stored
     on the printed ticket may be used to access a special bonus game or a
     special game play feature available on the gaming machine such as a
     chance to win a special jackpot. For instance, a player may commit five
     hundred loyalty points earned from a lodging purchase, stored on a
     loyalty program instrument, to activate a bonus feature on a gaming
     machine.
<BR><BR>[0073] In yet another embodiment, for convenience, a player may desire to
     combine loyalty points earned from a plurality of activities, such as
     gaming machine play, pit game play, merchandise purchases, etc., and
     stored on multiple loyalty program instruments onto a single loyalty
     program instrument. For example, a player may be issued a printed ticket
     or another type of loyalty program instrument from a gaming machine after
     a first game play session. At beginning of a second game play session, on
     the same or a different gaming machine, the player may insert the printed
     ticket into the gaming machine. After validating the ticket, the gaming
     machine may add any loyalty points stored on the ticket to any loyalty
     points earned by the player during the second game play session and issue
     a new loyalty point instrument, such as a printed ticket, with combined
     loyalty points.
<BR><BR>[0074] Since loyalty points may be redeemed for goods and services, the
     loyalty points may be considered as having a "cash value" of some type.
     Thus, since the loyalty points have a "cash value", it is important to
     prevent fraud, such as validating a single ticket multiple times or
     validating a duplicate copy of an already validated ticket, and to
     provide accounting means for tracking unvalidated and validated tickets.
     To prevent fraud and to provide accounting for loyalty program
     instruments, generation sites and validation sites for loyalty point
     instruments, such as but not limited gaming machines, casino kiosks,
     cashier stations, clerk validation terminals, pit games and wireless
     gaming devices, may 1) when a loyalty program instrument is generated at
     generation site, store loyalty program transaction information to both
     the loyalty program instrument and to a memory location separate from the
     loyalty program instrument and 2) when a loyalty program instrument is
     validated, loyalty program transaction information stored on the loyalty
     program instrument may be compared with loyalty program transaction
     information previously stored at the memory location.
<BR><BR>[0075] In one embodiment of the present invention, a clerk validation
     terminal (CVT), such as 336, 360 and 370, may be connected to a number of
     gaming devices that generate loyalty program instruments and the CVT may
     store loyalty program transaction information each time a loyalty program
     instrument is generated by one of the gaming devices connected to the
     CVTs issues a loyalty point instrument. For instant, CVT 360 is connected
     to gaming machines, 365, 366, 367, 368 and 369 in ring 356. The gaming
     machines 365, 366, 367, 368 and 369 may issue printed tickets as a
     loyalty program instrument. Each time one of the gaming machines issues a
     printed ticket, loyalty program transaction information describing the
     loyalty program transaction may be stored to the CVT and printed on the
     ticket.
<BR><BR>[0076] When the CVTs are not connected to one another or the gaming
     machines are not linked together in some manner, a loyalty program
     instrument from one gaming machine may be only be accepted in another
     gaming machine which is in a group of gaming machines connected to the
     same clerk validation terminal. For example, a loyalty program instrument
     issued from gaming machine 365 might be accepted at gaming machines 366,
     367, 368 and 369, which are each connected to the CVT 360, but not in
     gaming machines 375, 376, 377, 378, and 379, which are each connected to
     the CVT 370. In an analogous manner, when the cashless systems from one
     property are not connected together then a loyalty program instrument
     generated from gaming machine 366 may be not be used at property
     different from property 300.
<BR><BR>[0077] The CVTs, 336, 360 and 370, store loyalty instrument transaction
     information corresponding to the outstanding loyalty program instruments,
     including ticket vouchers, smart cards and debit cards, that are waiting
     for redemption. The CVTs may also store cashless instrument transaction
     information. In this embodiment, the CVTs are separate from the gaming
     machine. However, the loyalty program transaction information may be also
     be stored within each gaming machine or one gaming machine may
     functionally act as a CVT for a group of gaming machines eliminating the
     need for separate CVT hardware. In addition, loyalty program transaction
     information may be stored in a loyalty program server 310. As previously
     described, the loyalty program server may be an EZ PAY.TM. server that
     also supports cashless instrument transactions.
<BR><BR>[0078] As described above, the loyalty program transaction information may
     be used when the loyalty program instruments are validated in some manner
     such as for a prize redemption or to credit the points to a loyalty point
     account. The CVTs 336, 360 and 370 may store the information for the
     ticket vouchers printed by the gaming machines connected to the CVT. For
     example, CVT 360 stores ticket voucher information for ticket vouchers
     printed by gaming machines 365, 366, 367, 368, and 369. When a ticket is
     printed out or a loyalty point instrument is issued in some other manner,
     loyalty program transaction information is sent to the CVT using a
     communication protocol of some type from the gaming machine. For example,
     the gaming machine may send transaction information to the CVT which is
     part of the cashless system using the slot data system manufactured by
     Bally's Gaming Systems (Alliance Gaming Corporation, Las Vegas, Nev.) or
     the slot acquisition system manufacture by IGT, Reno, Nev.
<BR><BR>[0079] In present invention, when a player wishes to redeem a ticket or a
     loyalty program instrument of some other type, the player may redeem
     vouchers printed from a particular gaming machine at the CVT associated
     with the gaming machine or any other CVT which is part of the loyalty
     program instrument system associated with the CVT. For example, since CVT
     360 and CVT 370 are connected as part of a single cashless system to the
     EZ pay server 310, a player may redeem loyalty program instruments or
     utilize loyalty program instruments at the gaming machines, the CVT's
     (336, 360 or 370), the cashiers (325, 330 and 335), the casino kiosk 359,
     the other venues 338 or the wireless cashiers 358. To redeem a loyalty
     program instrument, the loyalty program instrument is validated by
     comparing information obtained from the instrument with information
     stored within the CVT or other gaming devices which behaves functionally
     as a CVT. After the loyalty program instrument has been redeemed, the CVT
     marks the instrument paid in a database to prevent an instrument with
     similar information from being cashed multiple times.
<BR><BR>[0080] Again, not all loyalty program systems may utilize CVTs, many of
     the functions of the CVT may be transferred to the cashless server,
     including the loyalty program server 310, eliminating the transferred
     function within the CVT. For instance, the cashless instrument
     transaction information may be stored in the loyalty program server 310
     instead of the CVTs. Thus, the need to store loyalty program transaction
     information within the CVT may be eliminated.
<BR><BR>[0081] In this embodiment, multiple groups of gaming machines connected to
     CVTs, such as 355 and 370, and other gaming devices in the other venues
     338 and the pit games 337 connected to CVT 336 are linked together in a
     cross validation network 345. The cross validation network is typically
     comprised of one or more concentrators 355 which accepts inputs from two
     or more CVTs and enables communications to and from the two or more CVTs
     using one communication line. The concentrator 355 is connected to a
     front end controller 350 which may poll the CVTs for loyalty program
     transaction information. The front end controller 350 is connected to an
     Loyalty Program server 310 which may provide a variety of information
     services for the loyalty program instrument system including accounting
     320, administration 315 and loyalty program account maintenance.
<BR><BR>[0082] In this invention, the loyalty program server is a hardware and a
     software platform allowing loyalty program instruments to be utilized at
     all of the loyalty program validation sites (e.g. cashier stations,
     gaming machines, wireless cashiers and CVTs) within the single property
     300. The loyalty program server 310 may also be used to provide
     multi-site validation of loyalty program instruments via a connection 311
     such as a network interface to a remote loyalty program transaction
     clearinghouse. The loyalty program server is a communication nexus in the
     cross validation network. For instance, the loyalty program server 310 is
     connected to the cashiers, wireless devices, remote cashless instrument
     transaction clearinghouse, CVTs and the gaming machines and other gaming
     devices via the CVTs.
<BR><BR>[0083] The cross validation network allows loyalty program instruments
     generated by any gaming machine connected to the cross validation network
     to be accepted by other gaming machines in the cross validation network
     345. Additionally, the cross validation network allows a cashier at a
     cashier station 325, 330, and 335 to validate any ticket voucher
     generated from a gaming machine within the cross validation network 345.
     As an example, to redeem a loyalty program instrument for goods and
     services, a player may present the instrument at one of the cashier
     stations 325, 330, and 335, the casino kiosk 359 or to a game service
     representative carrying a wireless gaming device 358 for validating
     loyalty program instruments. Loyalty program transaction information
     obtained from the instrument is used to validate the instrument by
     comparing information on the instrument with information stored on one of
     the CVTs connected to the cross validation network. In addition, when the
     loyalty program instrument was issued at another property, the
     information on the instrument may be stored at the other property. Thus,
     to validate the loyalty program instrument, the loyalty program server
     310 may have to communicate with the loyalty program transaction
     clearinghouse 341 via the remote connection 311 to obtain the information
     necessary to validate the instrument.
<BR><BR>[0084] As loyalty program instruments are validated, this information may
     be sent to audit services computer 340 providing audit services, the
     accounting computer 320 providing accounting services or the
     administration computer 315 providing administration services. In another
     embodiment, all of these services may be provided by loyalty program
     server 310 which may also be an EZPAY.TM. server. Examples of auditing
     services, which may be provided by loyalty program system software
     residing on the auditing computer 340 include 1) session reconciliation
     reports, 2) soft count reports, 3) soft count verification reports, 4)
     soft count exception reports, 5) machine instrument status reports and 5)
     security access report. Examples of accounting services, which may be
     provided by cashless system software residing on the accounting computer
     320 include a) instrument issuance reports, b) instrument liability
     reports, expired instrument reports, c) expired instrument validation
     reports and d) instrument redemption reports. Examples of administration
     services, which may be provided by loyalty program system software
     residing on the administration computer 315 include i) manual loyalty
     program instrument receipt, ii) manual loyalty program instrument report,
     iii) loyalty program instrument validation report, iv) interim validation
     report, v) validation window closer report, vi) voided loyalty program
     instrument receipt and vii) voided loyalty program instrument report.
<BR><BR>[0085] In another embodiment of the present invention, two or more gaming
     machines, such as 365, 366, 367, 368 and 369, may be linked together to
     allow loyalty points earned during the simultaneous game play of the two
     or more linked gaming machines to be combined on a single loyalty point
     instrument. Thus, a single game player playing two or more linked gaming
     machines simultaneously or a couple playing two or more linked gaming
     machines simultaneously may be able to receive a single loyalty point
     instrument issued from one of the linked gaming machines for their game
     play on all of the linked gaming machines. In another embodiment, based
     upon the combined amount of game play for two or more gaming machines
     linked together, the rate of loyalty points accrued may be increased.
     Thus, a couple playing together on two or more linked gaming machines
     simultaneously or a single person playing two or more linked gaming
     machines simultaneously may be able to earn more loyalty points than when
     playing on two or more non-linked gaming machines simultaneously.
<BR><BR>[0086] Turning to FIG. 4, more details of using loyalty program
     instruments in the context of game play on a gaming machine are
     described. In FIG. 4, a video gaming machine 2 of the present invention
     is shown. Machine 2 includes a main cabinet 4, which generally surrounds
     the machine interior (not shown) and is viewable by users. The main
     cabinet includes a main door 8 on the front of the machine, which opens
     to provide access to the interior of the machine. Attached to the main
     door are player-input switches or buttons 32, a coin acceptor 28, and a
     bill validator 30, a coin tray 38, and a belly glass 40. Viewable through
     the main door is a video display monitor 34 and an information panel 36.
     The display monitor 34 will typically be a cathode ray tube, high
     resolution flat-panel LCD, or other conventional electronically
     controlled video monitor. The information panel 36 may be a back-lit,
     silk screened glass panel with lettering to indicate general game
     information including, for example, the number of coins played. The bill
     validator 30, player-input switches 32, video display monitor 34, and
     information panel are devices used to play a game on the game machine 2.
     The devices are controlled by circuitry (see FIG. 2) housed inside the
     main cabinet 4 of the machine 2. Many possible games, including
     traditional slot games, video slot games, video poker, video black jack,
     video keno, video pachinko, lottery games and other games of chance as
     well as bonus games may be provided with gaming machines of this
     invention.
<BR><BR>[0087] The gaming machine 2 includes a top box 6, which sits on top of the
     main cabinet 4. The top box 6 houses a number of devices, which may be
     used to add features to a game being played on the gaming machine 2,
     including speakers 10, 12, 14, a ticket printer 18 which may print
     bar-coded tickets 20 used as loyalty point instruments or cashless
     instruments, a key pad 22 for entering player tracking information, a
     florescent display 16 for displaying player tracking information, a card
     reader 24 for entering a magnetic striped card containing player tracking
     information. Further, the top box 6 may house different or additional
     devices than shown in FIG. 4. For example, the top box may contain a
     bonus wheel or a back-lit silk screened panel which may be used to add
     bonus features to the game being played on the gaming machine. During a
     game, these devices are controlled and powered, in part, by circuitry,
     such as a master gaming controller, (See FIG. 2) housed within the main
     cabinet 4 of the machine 2.
<BR><BR>[0088] Understand that gaming machine 2 is but one example from a wide
     range of gaming machine designs on which the present invention may be
     implemented. For example, not all suitable gaming machines have top boxes
     or player tracking features. Further, some gaming machines have two or
     more game displays--mechanical and/or video. And, some gaming machines
     are designed for bar tables and have displays that face upwards. Still
     further, some machines may be designed entirely for cashless systems.
     Such machines may not include such features as bill validators, coin
     acceptors and coin trays. Instead, they may have only ticket readers,
     card readers and ticket dispensers. Those of skill in the art will
     understand that the present invention, as described below, can be
     deployed on most any gaming machine now available or hereafter developed.
<BR><BR>[0089] Returning to the example of FIG. 4, when a user wishes to play the
     gaming machine 2, he or she inserts cash through the coin acceptor 28 or
     bill validator 30. In addition, the player may use a cashless instrument
     of some type to register credits on the gaming machine 2. For example,
     the bill validator 30 may accept a printed ticket voucher, including 20,
     as an indicia of credit. As another example, the card reader 24 may
     accept a debit card or a smart card containing cash or credit information
     that may be used to register credits on the gaming machine. In addition,
     the player may use a loyalty program instrument, such as smart card,
     ticket voucher, or debit card, to register previously accumulated loyalty
     points on the gaming machine. Typically, the information contained on the
     cashless instrument or loyalty point instrument, including the ticket
     voucher, smart card or debit card, is validated by a cashless system or
     loyalty program system. As described above, the cashless system and
     loyalty program may be a single or separate systems in the present
     invention. The loyalty program instrument, including but not limited to a
     ticket voucher, smart card or debit card, may have been generated at the
     same property, for example a first casino where the gaming machine 2 is
     located or the instrument may have been generated at another property for
     example a second casino.
<BR><BR>[0090] As described above, on a gaming machine, loyalty points may
     redeemed for a number of purposes such as to access a special bonus
     feature available on the gaming machine or to obtain goods and services.
     The loyalty program instrument typically contains information used to
     register loyalty points on the gaming machine, including gaming machine
     2, and validate the registration transaction. For example, when a ticket
     voucher is used as a loyalty program instrument, the printed ticket
     voucher may contain information including but not limited to: 1) a ticket
     value, 2) a ticket issue date, 3) a ticket issue time, 4) a ticket
     transaction number, 5) a machine ID, 6) a ticket issue location and 7) a
     ticket sequence number. Information such as the ticket value, the ticket
     issue date, the ticket issue time, the ticket number and the machine ID
     may be common to loyalty program systems that generate and validate
     tickets issued at a single property. However, information such as the
     ticket issue location and other information may be needed to allow
     multi-site generation and validation of loyalty program instruments. In
     addition, other types of information, besides the information listed
     above, may be stored on the loyalty program instrument. For example, the
     ticket may contain information regarding a promotional prize that may be
     redeemed for loyalty points by the player when the ticket voucher is
     utilized in the gaming machine 2. As another example, the ticket may
     contain information such as a number of additional loyalty points that
     are needed to obtain a particular goods or services item.
<BR><BR>[0091] The information on the loyalty program instrument may be recorded
     on the loyalty program instrument when the loyalty instrument is
     generated. For example, in the case of the ticket voucher, the generation
     of the ticket voucher may refer to the actual printing of the ticket
     voucher on paper or some other medium. A unique bar-code may be printed
     on the ticket voucher which may be read with a bar-code scanner to obtain
     information from the ticket. The ticket voucher, including 20, may be
     printed from a printer, including printer 18. In the case of the smart
     card or debit card, the generation of the smart card or debit card refers
     to storing or encoding this information on the smart card or debit card.
     The generation of the debit card or smart card may occur when the smart
     card or debit card is inserted into the card reader 24 in the gaming
     machine 2 or at another site where smart cards or debit cards are issued.
     For example, smart cards or debit cards may be generated at ATM like
     terminals, at a cashier station when a player cashes out or prepaid smart
     cards or debits may be purchased within the gaming property (e.g.
     casino). As another example, the gaming machine may transfer loyalty
     point information to portable wireless device worn by the player via a
     wireless interface (not shown) on the gaming machine 2. After game play
     session where an amount of loyalty points have been awarded to the
     player, the amount of loyalty points awarded to the player and any other
     loyalty points input into the gaming machine may be downloaded to the
     portable wireless device worn by the player via the wireless interface.
<BR><BR>[0092] A game play session where loyalty points are accrued by the master
     gaming controller on gaming machine 2 or by another logic device located
     on the gaming machine 2 may occur after a particular game event initiated
     by a game player. For example, a loyalty point session, where loyalty
     points are accrued, may be triggered by one or more of the following game
     events: a) depositing an indicia of credit into the gaming machine [e.g.,
     inserting a cashless instrument into the card reader 24], b) inserting a
     bill or a cashless instrument into the bill validator 30, or inserting a
     coin in the coin acceptor 28, c) activating an input button on the gaming
     machine [e.g., input buttons 32], d) inputting a loyalty program
     instrument into a gaming device on the gaming machine [e.g. inserting an
     instrument in the bill validator 30 or the card reader 24], e) entering a
     code into the gaming machine [e.g., via the key pad 22 or via a touch
     screen] and f) combinations thereof. In the present invention, when the
     gaming machine has not received identification information from the
     gaming player, such as but not limited to a player tracking account
     information, loyalty points may be still be accrued during the game play
     session. The game play session where loyalty points are accrued may end
     following another game event such as but not limited to i) detecting zero
     credits registered on the gaming machine, ii) the gaming machine
     remaining idle for an amount of time, iii) detecting a tilt condition or
     detecting an error condition on the gaming machine, iv) detecting a game
     player's request for a loyalty program instrument and v) combinations
     thereof. After the loyalty point session ends, some or all of the loyalty
     points accrued during the session may be awarded to the game player. The
     loyalty points may be awarded to the player by storing the points to a
     loyalty program instrument which is issued to the player or the awarded
     points may be credited to the player's player tracking account after the
     player provides identification information to the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0093] During the course of a game play session, a player may be required
     to make a number of decisions, which affect the outcome of one or more
     games played during the game play session. For example, a player may vary
     his or her wager on a particular game, select a prize for a particular
     game, or make game decisions which affect the outcome of a particular
     game. The player may make these choices using the player-input switches
     32, the video display screen 34 or using some other device which enables
     a player to input information into the gaming machine. During certain
     game events, the gaming machine 2 may display visual and auditory effects
     that can be perceived by the player. These effects add to the excitement
     of a game, which makes a player more likely to continue playing. Auditory
     effects include various sounds that are projected by the speakers 10, 12,
     14. Visual effects include flashing lights, strobing lights or other
     patterns displayed from lights on the gaming machine 2 or from lights
     behind the belly glass 40.
<BR><BR>[0094] After the player has completed a game play session, a loyalty
     program instrument or cashless instrument may be generated at the gaming
     machine 2. The loyalty program instrument or cashless instrument may be a
     printed ticket voucher, a smart card, debit card or other cashless
     medium. Prior to issuing the instrument, the loyalty points awarded to
     the player may be displayed on the main display 34, the secondary display
     42 or the player tracking display 16. Also, a prize menu may be displayed
     on one or more displays on the gaming machine 2 such as the main display
     34, the secondary display 42 or the player tracking display 16. The prize
     menu may include one or more goods and services items. To redeem a
     particular prize, a particular amount of loyalty points is needed. As
     service items, the game player may be able to convert the awarded loyalty
     points to frequent flyer miles, obtain a free meal with the loyalty
     points or obtain a free nights lodging with the loyalty points. As an
     example of goods items, a player may be able to redeem loyalty points for
     clothes, food items, electronic goods, etc.
<BR><BR>[0095] In some embodiments, the player may transfer the awarded loyalty
     points to a player tracking account. After providing account information
     (e.g., by inserting a player tracking card), the player tracking points
     may be transferred to a player tracking account of the player directly on
     the gaming machine (see FIG. 5). In other embodiments, the player may
     credit player tracking points or loyalty points, stored on a loyalty
     point instrument, to a player tracking account 1) over the phone, 2) at a
     clerk validation terminal, 3) at a cashier station, 4) at a casino kiosk,
     5) via a web-interface, 6) via mail or 7) through a hand-held wireless
     device.
<BR><BR>[0096] The game player may select one of the goods and services items from
     the prize menu using an input mechanism of some type. For instance, the
     prize menu may be displayed on a touch screen and the player may touch
     the screen to select one of the goods and services items. When the amount
     of loyalty points required to redeem the selected prize is less than an
     amount of loyalty points available on the gaming machine, a loyalty
     program instrument containing the prize instrument may be issued. For
     instance, when loyalty points are redeemed for a free meal, the player
     may be issued a ticket 22 from printer 18 which may be used to obtain a
     free meal when presented at one or more restaurants listed on the ticket.
<BR><BR>[0097] In some embodiments of the present invention loyalty points accrued
     during the game play session may be combined with previously earned
     loyalty points to redeem a prize. Thus, loyalty points stored in one or
     more of a player's loyalty program accounts, such as a player tracking
     account, or loyalty points earned during other activities stored on one
     or more loyalty program instruments available to the player may be used
     to redeem prizes on the gaming machine. For instance, the player may
     insert five printed tickets containing various amounts of loyalty points
     into the gaming machine 2 using the bill validator 30. After each ticket
     has been validated, as described with reference to FIG. 3, the loyalty
     points stored on each ticket may be added to the amount loyalty points
     available on the gaming machine. As another example, the player may
     request that loyalty points be deducted from a loyalty program account
     such as a player tracking account. In this case, the gaming machine may
     send a message to remote server storing the loyalty point account
     information and request that some amount of loyalty points be deducted
     from the player's account. Assuming the amount of requested points is
     available, the requested points may be deducted from the player's account
     and then transferred to the gaming machine. Finally, the method described
     above, may be implemented when the player has not accrued any loyalty
     points during a particular game playing session. For instance, the player
     may desire to redeem a prize using one or more loyalty program
     instruments storing loyalty points previously earned by the game player.
<BR><BR>[0098] In another embodiment of the present invention, a single instrument
     may store both cash transaction information and loyalty program
     information. For instance, a smart card may be used to load credits onto
     a gaming machine and cash out an award from the gaming machine. Also, the
     smart card may be used to store loyalty program information generated
     during one or more of a player's game playing activities. Further, the
     smart card may store prize information for a prize redeemed at a gaming
     machine using loyalty points accrued by the game player.
<BR><BR>[0099] FIG. 5 is a flow chart depicting a method of rewarding loyalty
     points accrued anonymously on a gaming machine. In 500, a gaming machine
     receives an input of some type from a game player that has not provided
     any identification information, such as player tracking information. The
     input, which may be a number of different gaming events, as described
     with reference to FIG. 4, such as the player depositing a indicia of
     credit into the gaming machine, triggers a game play session on the
     gaming machine where loyalty points may be accrued. In 505, a game play
     session is presented on the gaming machine which may include the player
     wagering on a number of different games of chance and game outcome
     presentation corresponding to each wager. For instance, the player may
     make 5 different wagers on 5 slot games presented on the gaming machine.
     In 510, a gaming event triggers the end of the game play session and an
     amount of loyalty points accrued during the game play session are
     determined. The gaming event ending the game play session may be but is
     not limited to 1) detecting zero credits registered on the gaming
     machine, 2) the gaming machine remaining idle for an amount of time, 3)
     detecting a tilt condition or detecting an error condition on the gaming
     machine, and 4) detecting a game player's request for a loyalty program
     instrument. A rate at which the player accrues loyalty points during the
     game play session may vary according to one or more of a time of day,
     days of a week, months of a year, an amount wagered, a game denomination,
     a promotional event, a game type and a rate of wagering. After the amount
     of loyalty points accrued during the game play session have been
     determined, some or all of the accrued loyalty points may be awarded to
     the game player. For instance, a player that does not have a loyalty
     program account may be awarded a higher fraction of the accrued points
     than a player that already has an account to encourage the player without
     an account to sign up for a new account.
<BR><BR>[0100] In 515, the gaming machine may display the amount of loyalty points
     accrued during the game play session to one or more display screens on
     the gaming machine (see FIG. 4). In 517, the player may be offered the
     option to exchange loyalty points for a prize of some type such as goods
     or services. In 520, when a prize redemption is requested, a prize menu
     may be displayed to one or more display screens on the gaming machine.
     The prize menu may contain a list of prizes available and a number of
     loyalty points corresponding to each prize that must be redeemed to
     obtain each prize. In 525, a player may select a prize. In 530, when the
     player does not have enough loyalty points available to obtain the prize,
     the prize menu in 520 may be redisplayed and the player may be asked to
     make another selection or given an option to exit from the menu.
<BR><BR>[0101] In one embodiment, the player may be given the option (not shown)
     of viewing loyalty point account information from a loyalty point account
     such as a player tracking account available to the player. In this case,
     the player may enter loyalty program account information into the gaming
     machine using some method. For example, the game player may insert a
     player tracking card into a card reader on the gaming machine and type in
     an identification number corresponding to the card such as a PIN number.
     When the card has been validated, the player may view player tracking
     account information. Next, to redeem a prize requiring a certain number
     of loyalty points, when a player does not have enough loyalty points
     available on the gaming machine, the player may request that loyalty
     points be transferred to the gaming machine from a remote loyalty point
     account. The gaming machine may send a request for an amount of loyalty
     points to a remote server. When the loyalty point transaction has been
     approved, the remote server may send the requested loyalty points to the
     gaming machine and delete the requested points from the player's account.
     Then, the transferred loyalty points may be added to loyalty points
     already available on the gaming machine and used to redeem a prize.
<BR><BR>[0102] In 535, when a prize selection has been made and there are enough
     loyalty points available on the gaming machine to redeem the prize, a
     prize instrument may be issued to the game player. For instance, the
     gaming machine may print a ticket for a free meal at a restaurant. The
     issued ticket may be taken to a restaurant and, after the ticket has been
     validated, used to obtain a free meal.
<BR><BR>[0103] In 540, after a prize redemption and points are still remaining,
     the player may be given the option, in 518, of updating a remote loyalty
     account with the remaining points. When a player does not request a prize
     redemption, the player may be directly presented the option to update a
     remote loyalty point account with some or all of the points awarded
     during the game play session. In 519, the player may enter loyalty
     program account information into the gaming machine using some method.
     For example, the game player may insert a player tracking card into a
     card reader on the gaming machine and type in an identification number
     corresponding to the card such as a PIN number. In 521, when the loyalty
     program account information has been validated by the remote server, the
     gaming machine may send a request to the remote server requesting that an
     amount of loyalty points awarded to the player be added to the player's
     loyalty program account.
<BR><BR>[0104] In 545, when loyalty points remain on the gaming machine, the
     gaming machine may issue a loyalty point instrument storing the remaining
     loyalty points. For instance, the gaming machine may issue a printed
     ticket voucher redeemable for a certain amount of loyalty points. In 550,
     the gaming machine may store to a local database residing on the gaming
     machine loyalty program transaction information for one or more loyalty
     program transactions performed by the gaming machine such as but not
     limited to 1) loyalty point awards, 2) prize redemptions, 3) requests for
     loyalty program account information, 4) requests to add loyalty points to
     remote account, 5) requests to delete loyalty points from a remote
     account and 6) information regarding issued loyalty point instruments. In
     550, loyalty program transaction information may also be sent to a remote
     server in lieu of storing the information on the gaming machine or in
     conjunction with storing the information on the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0105] FIG. 6 is a flow chart depicting a method for validating
     information stored on a loyalty point instrument at a validation site
     connected to a cross validation network as described with reference to
     FIG. 3. In the embodiment shown in the figure, a loyalty point instrument
     is validated in a manner consistent with an EZPAY.TM. cashless system. In
     600, a request for game service transaction information read from a
     loyalty point instrument is sent via a network interface on the gaming
     device validating the instrument to a loyalty program server. The gaming
     device may be a gaming machine, a casino kiosk, a hand-held wireless
     device or a CVT. In 605, the server identifies which gaming device owns
     the instrument. When a gaming device owns an instrument, the gaming
     device has stored information regarding the status of a particular
     instrument issued from a instrument generation site connected to the
     gaming device. As an example, as described with reference to FIG. 3, the
     gaming device may be a CVT connected to a number of gaming machines that
     generate loyalty program instruments. In 610, the server sends a request
     to validate the instrument to the gaming device identified as the owner
     of the instrument. Typically, the validation request indicates a service
     on the instrument has been requested. For instance, for a loyalty program
     ticket, a validation request may mean a request to access the loyalty
     points stored on the ticket has been made. For a loyalty program ticket
     valid for a free meal, a validation request may mean a request to obtain
     the meal has been made. In 615, the instrument owner receives the
     validation request for the instrument and marks the instrument
     transaction pending. While the instrument transaction is pending, any
     attempts to validate a loyalty program instrument with similar
     information is blocked by the instrument owner.
<BR><BR>[0106] In 620, the instrument owner sends back a reply with context
     information to the server. As an example, the context information may be
     the time and place when the instrument was issued. The information from
     the instrument owner to the server may be sent as one or more date
     packets according to a communication standard shared by the instrument
     owner and server. In 625, after receiving the validation reply from the
     instrument owner, the server marks the validation request pending and
     sends a validation order to the gaming device validating the instrument.
     While the validation request is pending, the server will not allow
     another instrument with the same information as the instrument with the
     validation request pending to be validated.
<BR><BR>[0107] In 630, the gaming device may chose to accept or reject the
     validation order from the server. For instance, using a <B><I>security
     protocol,</I></B> the gaming device may determine the validation order is
     invalid. As another example, an employee using a gaming device to
     validate loyalty program instruments may decide not to validate an
     instrument for some reason. When the gaming device accepts the validation
     order from the server, in 640, the gaming device sends a reply to the
     transaction server confirming that the transaction has been performed.
     The loyalty program server marks the request validated or completed which
     prevents another instrument with identical information from being
     validated. In 645, the server sends a confirmation to the instrument
     owner which allows the instrument owner to mark the request from pending
     to validated. When the gaming device rejects the validation order from
     the server, in 650, the gaming device sends a reply to the server to mark
     the validation request from pending to unvalidated. When the instrument
     transaction is marked unvalidated, it may be validated by another gaming
     device at a later time. In 655, the server sends the reply to the
     instrument transaction owner to mark the validation request from pending
     to unvalidated which allows the instrument to be validated later.
<BR><BR>[0108] FIG. 7 is a block diagram of loyalty program systems at multiple
     gaming properties connected to a loyalty program transaction
     clearinghouse server. At least three gaming devices, a loyalty program
     server 310 at property 300 (described with reference to FIG. 3), a
     loyalty program server 710 at property 700 and one or more gaming devices
     along a route venue 702, may communicate with the loyalty program
     transaction clearing house server 341. The route may comprise a plurality
     of gaming machines or other devices issuing loyalty program instruments
     located in various venues such as stores and bars. The example is for
     illustrative purposes only, as many different combinations of gaming
     devices using different network topologies may be connected to the
     loyalty point instrument and prize clearinghouse 341. At property 300,
     one or more gaming machines, such as gaming machine 369, send loyalty
     program transaction information to the clerk validation terminal 360. The
     CVT 360 sends information to the loyalty program server 310 which may
     also be cashless server and data acquisition system. In this embodiment,
     the functions of the controller 350 and concentrator 355, as described
     with reference to FIG. 3, are combined into the loyalty program server
     310. The loyalty point instruments used on property 300 may be smart
     cards, magnetic cards, ticket vouchers, room keys, debit cards, portable
     wireless devices and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0109] The loyalty program server 310 contains a network interface used to
     send information on loyalty point instruments generated on property 300
     to the clearinghouse server 341 or request information 300 from the
     clearinghouse server 341 on loyalty point instruments issued at other
     properties that are being validated at property, including instruments
     issued at property 700 and venues along route 702. The loyalty program
     transaction information sent to the loyalty program server 310 from the
     clearinghouse server 341 and received by the clearinghouse server from
     the loyalty program server 310 is transmitted via the network connection
     311. Further, details of information transmitted between a cashless
     server and a cashless clearinghouse server in regards to multi-property
     cashless instrument validation as well as server hardware, which may be
     applicable to multi-property loyalty program instrument validation, are
     described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/684,382 by Rowe filed Aug. 25,
     2000 entitled "Cashless Transaction Clearinghouse."
<BR><BR>[0110] At property 700 gaming machines, such as gaming machine 769, and
     other gaming devices located at other venues 738, such as a loyalty point
     instrument generation site at a pit game, are connected to the loyalty
     program server and data acquisition system 710 via the local network 712.
     The local network 712 may be a wireless or wired connection system
     including fiber, copper or wireless cellular, combinations of all three
     or other connection systems. A separate CVT is not shown in this
     embodiment. The functions of the CVT including storage of loyalty program
     transaction information may be built into one or more the gaming machines
     including 769 or may be built into the loyalty program server 710. The
     information sent to the loyalty program server 710 from the clearinghouse
     server 341 and received by the clearing house server 341 from the loyalty
     program server 710 is transmitted via the network connection 711. Along
     the route venue 702, one or more gaming machine and other gaming devices
     located in a plurality of properties send and receive loyalty program
     transaction information for the clearinghouse 341 via an Internet
     connection 712.
<BR><BR>[0111] Components of the transaction clearinghouse server 341 may include
     1) a memory storage unit for storing loyalty program transaction
     information in a transaction database, 2) a functional router enabling
     communication between the clearinghouse server and different properties,
     3) a logic devices such as one or microprocessors, 4) a memory containing
     software for implementing the clearinghouse functions and 5) a network
     interface. The transaction database may contain on-going and past loyalty
     point instrument transactions processed using the clearinghouse server.
     The transaction database may be implemented using Microsoft NT
     (Microsoft, Redmond, Wash.) and SQL (server query language). The loyalty
     program servers, including 310 and 710, may also utilize this database
     technology.
<BR><BR>[0112] Loyalty program instrument transaction information for two or more
     gaming properties may be stored in the clearinghouse server transaction
     database. The properties may be owned by the same or different gaming
     establishments. The transaction database may be accessed remotely by the
     properties, including 300 and 700, utilizing the clearinghouse server
     341. Further, the transaction database may be used with analysis software
     to analyze transactions routed through the clearinghouse server 341.
<BR><BR>[0113] The requirements associated with accounting and reporting of the
     loyalty program instrument information may be dependent on the
     regulations within a particular gaming jurisdiction. That being the case,
     the system is adaptable to those particular regulations. In general, a
     loyalty program instrument with an award amount may be considered to be
     analogous to a personal check written by the property where it was
     generated. When the loyalty program instrument is validated, it is
     essentially cashed. This implies that the property where the cashless
     instrument was generated must maintain a database of data related to
     those loyalty program instruments that were created on its property. This
     is analogous to maintaining a bank account whose sole purpose is to cover
     the loyalty program instruments that were generated at the property. This
     property is usually responsible for maintaining its loyalty program
     instrument database and validating loyalty program instruments. When a
     request to validate a loyalty program instrument is received by the
     loyalty program system at a particular gaming property, the property has
     the option of validating or rejecting the request. Once the property
     validates the loyalty program instrument, it is typically the
     responsibility of that property to insure its own loyalty program
     instrument transaction database is updated. At that time, the property
     which generated the loyalty program instrument, may transfer the funds to
     the property requesting the validation. The fund transfers may occur with
     each transaction or could be compiled in a batch to cover multiple
     instrument validation transactions on a periodic basis, eg. once a night.
     The transaction clearinghouse may facilitate all associated electronic
     fund transfers (EFTs) and acts as a third party between the parties.
<BR><BR>[0114] FIG. 8 is an interaction diagram for a loyalty program instrument
     transaction between a clearinghouse, loyalty program servers, and loyalty
     program instrument generators/validators where the loyalty program
     instrument is generated at a different location from where it is
     validated. In 804, awarded loyalty points are generated on a loyalty
     program instrument at a loyalty program instrument generation site 802 at
     property 300. The loyalty program generation site may include but is not
     limited to a gaming machine, a clerk validation terminal, a wireless
     validation terminal, a casino kiosk and a cashier station. The loyalty
     program instrument may include a printed ticket voucher (e.g. EZPAY.TM.
     ticket), a smart card, a debit card, a room key and a portable wireless
     device. In 806, when the loyalty program instrument is generated, loyalty
     program transaction information, including but not limited to 1) a value,
     2) an issue date, 3) an issue time, 4) a transaction number unique to the
     transaction, 5) a machine ID that generated the loyalty program
     instrument, 6) an issue location and 7) an instrument sequence number,
     may be transmitted to the loyalty program server 310. The loyalty program
     instrument transaction information is also stored on the loyalty program
     instrument when the loyalty program instrument is generated in 804. In
     808, the loyalty program server 310 may store the loyalty program
     instrument transaction information in a database. The transaction
     information stored in the database is used when the loyalty program
     instrument is validated. The validation process may be invoked when the
     loyalty program instrument is redeemed for a prize or when the loyalty
     program instrument is used in a gaming machine or other device that
     accepts the loyalty program instrument. The validation process involves
     comparing the loyalty program instrument transaction information stored
     on the loyalty program instrument with the loyalty program instrument
     transaction information stored in the loyalty program server database.
<BR><BR>[0115] In 810, a game player takes the loyalty program instrument
     generated at property 300 to property 700. In 812, the game player
     presents the loyalty program instrument for a prize redemption at a
     loyalty program transaction validation site 800 at property 700. The
     loyalty program transaction validation site may include a gaming machine,
     a cashier station, a clerk validation terminal, a wireless validation
     device and any other devices which accept loyalty program instruments.
     For instance, when a debit card is used as the loyalty program
     instrument, the game player may be able to directly deposit the awarded
     loyalty points on the debit card into a loyalty program account, such as
     a player tracking account, accessible to the game player. In 814, a
     validation request is sent from the loyalty program transaction
     validation site 800 to the loyalty program server 710. The validation
     request may be an information packet containing the transaction
     information stored on the loyalty program instrument in 804 and stored in
     the loyalty program server database in 808.
<BR><BR>[0116] In 816, the loyalty program server 710 may check the local loyalty
     program transaction database on the loyalty program server 710 to
     determine if the loyalty program instrument was generated at property
     300. The loyalty program server may check the local loyalty program
     transaction database in a number of ways to determine whether a
     transaction record for the loyalty program instrument resides in the
     database. The database search technique may depend on what information is
     stored in the local database and what information is stored on the
     loyalty program instrument. When the loyalty program instrument was
     generated at a property using a different loyalty program system than the
     property where the loyalty program instrument is validated, the type and
     amount of loyalty program instrument transaction information stored on
     the loyalty program instrument may differ from the type and amount of
     loyalty program transaction information stored on the local loyalty
     program transaction instrument database. Thus, the search technique may
     depend on determining a common set of transaction information stored on
     the loyalty program instrument being validated and stored in the loyalty
     program transaction database. For instance, when the loyalty program
     instrument contains a machine ID and the loyalty program transaction
     database stores a list of all the local machine IDs, the loyalty program
     server 710 may search the local loyalty program transaction database to
     determine whether the loyalty program instrument was generated on one of
     the local machines at the property 700. As another example, when the
     loyalty program instrument contains transaction information on the
     property where the loyalty program instrument was generated or the owner
     of the loyalty program instrument (e.g. the owner of the property), the
     loyalty program server 710 may quickly determine whether the loyalty
     program instrument was generated at the local property 700.
<BR><BR>[0117] In 818, when the loyalty program instrument was not generated
     locally, the loyalty program server 710 may mark the validation request
     pending in a local database and send a request for validation to the
     central clearinghouse 341 in 820. The request for validation from the
     loyalty program server 710 to the loyalty program instrument transaction
     clearinghouse 341 may contain all or some subset of the information
     stored on the loyalty program instrument being validated. In addition,
     the request for validation may contain information about the loyalty
     program transaction validation site. For example, the identification
     information about the loyalty program transaction validation site 800,
     the property 700 where the loyalty program transaction validation site is
     being validated and the owner of the may be included in the request for
     validation message.
<BR><BR>[0118] As in 814, the request for validation in 820 may be an information
     packet of some type sent using a pre-determined communication protocol
     between the loyalty program server 710 and the central clearinghouse 341.
     The communication protocol used to transmit transaction information
     between the loyalty program transaction validation site 800 and the
     loyalty program server 710 in 814 may be the same or different than the
     communication protocol used to transmit the transaction information
     between the loyalty program server 710 and the loyalty program instrument
     transaction clearinghouse 341 in 820.
<BR><BR>[0119] In 822, the loyalty program transaction clearinghouse determines
     the owner of the loyalty program instrument (e.g. the property where the
     loyalty program instrument was generated). The clearinghouse 341
     determines the owner based upon information received in the validation
     request in 820 and based upon information stored in the clearinghouse
     341. In 824, using routing information stored within the clearinghouse
     341, a request for validation is sent from the clearinghouse 341 to the
     property where the loyalty program instrument was generated (i.e.
     property 300 in this embodiment). The request for validation is an
     information packet in a communication protocol of some type. The
     transaction information contained within the information packet is
     sufficient to allow the loyalty program server 310 at the loyalty program
     generation site 802 at property 300 to validate the loyalty program
     instrument. The communication protocol used to transmit the transaction
     information between the loyalty program server 310 and the clearinghouse
     341 in 820 may be the same or different than the communication protocol
     used to transmit the transaction information between the loyalty program
     instrument transaction clearinghouse 341 and the loyalty program server
     710 in 824. For example, the communication protocols may be different
     when the loyalty program system used at property 700 is different from
     the loyalty program system used at property 300.
<BR><BR>[0120] In 826, the loyalty program server 300 checks the local loyalty
     program instrument transaction database to confirm the request for
     validation received in 824 is valid. When the transaction is valid (e.g.
     the loyalty program instrument was generated at property 300 and has not
     been previously validated), in 831, an approval message may be sent from
     the loyalty program server 310 to the clearinghouse 341, in 832, the
     clearinghouse may forward or generate the approval message to the loyalty
     program sever 710, in 834, the loyalty program server 310 may forward or
     generate the approval message to the loyalty program transaction
     validation site 800. In 828, the loyalty program server may represent the
     transaction as a debit and cover the debit by allocating or transferring
     funds to an account used to cover debits. For example, each loyalty point
     may be assigned a pre-determined value such as a $0.01 US dollars. In
     830, the loyalty program server 310 may send an Electronic Fund Transfer
     (EFT) to cover the debit to the clearinghouse 341. The EFT may be sent
     after each transfer or may be sent as a batch at the end of some time
     period, e.g. at the end of each day.
<BR><BR>[0121] In 836, the validation site 800 at property 700, performs an
     appropriate operation when the validation is approved. For example, when
     the validation site 800 is a gaming machine, loyalty points may be posted
     on the gaming machine. As another example, when the validation site 800
     is a cashier station, the player may receive a prize according to the
     value of the loyalty program instrument.
<BR><BR>[0122] In FIGS. 9-13, apparatus and methods are described that allows
     gaming information for gaming services, such as but not limited to
     anonymous loyalty program session, a non-anonymous loyalty program
     session and cashless transactions to be entered into a gaming machine.
     The apparatus and methods employ a non-physical contact data interface
     that allows for data to be read from a loyalty program instrument without
     physical contact between the data interface and the loyalty program
     instrument. As was described with respect to FIG. 2, examples of
     non-physical contact data interface include a bar-code scanner and a
     wireless interface.
<BR><BR>[0123] In providing a loyalty program session, the use of a non-physical
     contact data interface to read data from a loyalty program instrument
     provides many advantages over a card reader and a magnetic striped card.
     The card reader and a magnetic striped card are commonly employed in
     providing a player tracking session on a gaming machine. The data
     interface in a card reader requires physical contact between a magnetic
     head and the magnetic-stripe on the card to read data from the card.
     Details of reading data from a magnetic striped card are described next
     and then details of input mechanisms using a non-physical contact data
     interface to read data from a loyalty program instrument are described
     with respect to FIGS. 9-13.
<BR><BR>[0124] When a magnetic striped card is used in a player tracking session,
     which is one type of loyalty program session, the session is initiated
     when physical contact between the magnetic stripe and magnetic reader is
     detected. Typically, the card is inserted in a card reader. For a
     successful read of the magnetic stripe, the length of the stripe must be
     moved over a magnetic head in the card reader. The movement of the
     magnetic stripe over the magnetic head can be supplied by 1) a force
     supplied by a user (e.g., the act of the user inserting the card forces
     the stripe over the magnetic head) or 2) a force supplied by
     servo-mechanisms within the card reader.
<BR><BR>[0125] For a successful read, the card must be inserted correctly in the
     card reader. A correct orientation is when the card inserted in a manner
     that allows the magnetic stripe to come in contact with the magnetic
     head. Typically, a standard magnetic striped card is designed with a
     top-side and a bottom-side where the magnetic stripe is located across
     the bottom side of the card in an off-center location. A card reader used
     with the standard magnetic stripe card requires the card to be inserted
     with the topside facing upwards and the magnetic stripe on the left side
     of the card slot. If the card is inserted up-side down or the card is
     inserted in the card slot with the stripe on the opposite side of the
     location of the magnetic head then the data is not read from the card.
<BR><BR>[0126] The magnetic head is used to read data stored on a number of tracks
     on the magnetic stripe. The magnetic stripe may contain a number of
     tracks, usually three, but all of the tracks may not be used. In most
     player tracking implementations, the first track is used to store a
     number, the number is an index to a record in a player tracking database.
     The second track is used to store a name such as the property where the
     card was issued. The third track is not used. The first track usually
     contains up to 80 characters of data and the second track contains up to
     40 characters of data.
<BR><BR>[0127] When the index number is read from the card, the number is
     transmitted to a remote server. The index number is used by the remote
     server to retrieve a player tracking record corresponding to the index
     number. An index number to a record in a database is used because the
     magnetic striped card does not have the storage capacity to store the
     record.
<BR><BR>[0128] A portion of the information stored in the record may be
     transmitted back to the gaming machine. The gaming machine may use the
     information transmitted from the server to generate a player tracking
     session and to provide other personalized gaming services. For instance,
     the record referenced by the index number may supply information, such
     as, 1) a player identification number, 2) a social security number, 3) a
     name, 4) an address, 5) a credit number, 6) a player rating, 7)
     complimentary (comp.) information, 8) a player preference tracking number
     and 9) a casino preference tracking number. In addition, information
     relating to games, game features, gaming machine settings, prizes,
     promotions and food/beverage services preferred by the game player may be
     stored in the record.
<BR><BR>[0129] For the generation of a player tracking session, the striped card
     is inserted in the card reader, the index number is read from the
     magnetic striped card and then is transmitted to the remote server. As
     part of the validation process for the player tracking session, a player
     may be required to enter a PIN number. After the session is validated,
     parameters from game play performed on the gaming machine, such as an
     amount bet, is converted to player tracking points by the remote server.
     The player tracking session ends when the player removes the magnetic
     striped card from the card reader.
<BR><BR>[0130] When a magnetic striped card storing an index to a record in a
     database is used to initiate a player tracking session, a number of
     factors can prevent the implementation of the player tracking session.
     For example, if the magnetic stripe on the card can't be read because the
     stripe has been damaged or de-magnetized, then the player tracking
     session is not initiated. As another example, if the magnetic striped
     card is not inserted in the card reader, then the player tracking session
     is not initiated. The card may not be inserted because the player may
     forget to insert the card or may have forgotten to bring their card as
     previously described. In another example, the player can insert their
     card incorrectly, such as, up-side down or backwards, which prevent the
     card from being read and thus a player tracking card from being
     initiated. If communication is unavailable between the gaming machine and
     a remote server, then the player tracking session may not be initiated.
     If the player is required to enter a PIN number and the player has
     forgotten their number, then the player tracking session can't be
     initiated. Finally, if the player the leaves the magnetic striped card in
     the card reader, then the card can be lost. Until, the card is re-placed,
     the player may not be able to generate a player tracking session.
<BR><BR>[0131] It is beneficial to the casino that operates a loyalty program and
     a player that is a member in the program to make the process of
     participating as simple and as foolproof as possible. Fool-proofing the
     process requires addressing the issues that prevent the loyalty program
     session from being initiated. As is described with respect to FIGS. 9-13,
     input mechanisms using non-physical contact data interfaces can be used
     to make the initiation of a loyalty program session on a gaming machine
     more fool proof.
<BR><BR>[0132] FIGS. 9A-9D are block diagrams of loyalty program instruments and
     data formats of the present invention. In FIG. 9A, a substrate 900 with a
     1-D bar-code is shown. The 1-D bar-code may be used to encode an index to
     a record in a database. A standard Universal Product Code (UPC) symbol
     provides a 12 digit number. However, longer or shorter numbers may be
     encoded in a 1-D bar-code format. In FIG. 9B, a substrate with a 1-D
     bar-code and a 2-D bar-codes 904 are shown. The 2-D bar-codes, as is to
     be described as follows, may be used to encode a much large amount of
     data than a 1-D bar code. In FIGS. 9A and 9B, the 1-D bar-codes and 2-D
     bar-codes may be read with a bar-code reader, such as a LS 6800 series
     bar-code reader from Symbol Technologies (Holtsville, N.Y.). The LS 6800
     is incorporated in a rectangular box of dimensions of a height of 1.75
     inches a width of 2.75 inches and a depth of 4.5 inches.
<BR><BR>[0133] In FIG. 9A, the substrate 900 is printed with three 1-D bar-codes
     902. The 1-D bar-codes encode the same number or different numbers. For
     instance, the bar-codes at the edge of the substrate 9A may encode one
     number while the large bar-code in the center of the substrate 900 may
     encode a different number than then number at the edges. The size and
     orientations of the 1-D barcodes allow the bar-codes to be read at
     different orientations and distances from the bar-code reader.
<BR><BR>[0134] In one embodiment, the bar-codes (1-D/2-D) may be printed on a
     substrate, such as a plastic wallet sized rectangular shaped card (e.g.,
     credit card sized), a printed ticket and a plastic device designed to be
     attached to a key ring. In this case, the bar-codes may be printed on the
     top-side of the substrate, the bottom side of the substrate or both. The
     information encoded on the top-side and the bottom side of the substrate
     900 may be the same or may be different. When the information is on the
     top-side and the bottom-side is the same, the information may be read
     from the substrate when either top-side or the bottom side is orientated
     toward the reader. In another embodiment, different information may be
     optionally encoded on the top-side and the bottom-side of the substrate.
     For instance, a 1-D bar-code may be printed on a top-side of the
     substrate 900 and an optional 2-D bar-code may be printed on the bottom
     side of the substrate. In this case, information may be read from a first
     side of the substate and the substrate may be optionally flipped to read
     information from the second side of the substrate.
<BR><BR>[0135] In one embodiment of the present invention, the 1-D/2-D bar-codes
     may be printed on a substrate with an adhesive backing. Thus, the
     substrate may be attached to a plurality of devices that may be carried
     by the player. For instance, the substrate may be attached to a credit
     card carried by the player, a magnetic striped room key, a cell phone, a
     person digital assistant, a watch band, a purse, a wallet, an item of
     clothing, etc. The surface on which the printed substrate is attached
     does not necessarily have to be flat. Many bar-code readers are capable
     of reading bar-codes placed on curved surfaces. A player may be issued a
     sheet of bar-codes with adhesive backing so that the bar-codes may be
     placed on a plurality of devices.
<BR><BR>[0136] In another embodiment, the bar-code may be printed on a bracelet
     that may be worn by the player, similar to a hospital bracelet. The
     player may place the bracelet near the bar-code reader to have it read.
     After the player is finished with the bracelet, it may be discarded.
<BR><BR>[0137] In one embodiment, a plurality of bar-codes corresponding to
     different loyalty programs may be located on the same substrate. Player
     tracking clubs run by different casinos use different index numbers for
     their clubs that are not compatible. Thus, a player that gambles at a
     plurality of casinos may be required to carry a plurality of player
     tracking clubs to participate in a player tracking session at each of the
     clubs. With the present invention, bar-codes from different player
     tracking clubs may be printed on the same substrate or attached the same
     substrate using a bar-code printed on an adhesive backing. At the start
     of the loyalty program session, the plurality of bar-codes may be scanned
     from the substrate, the scanned numbers may be analyzed to determine if
     any are valid for the gaming machine or gaming device on which the player
     has requested a loyalty program session. When one of the scanned numbers
     is valid, then a loyalty program session may be initiated on the gaming
     machine. An advantage of this embodiment is that the number of player
     tracking cards carried by the player may be reduced.
<BR><BR>[0138] In another embodiment, the gaming machine or another gaming device
     may be capable of scanning a plurality of 1-D bar-codes and 2-D bar-codes
     and combining them on a single instrument. For example, a plurality of
     1-D bar-codes providing index numbers for a plurality of player tracking
     clubs may be read by the bar-code reader or the index numbers may be read
     by another input device on the gaming machine. Then, the all of the 1-D
     bar-codes may be formatted and printed on a single instrument, such as a
     printable media with an adhesive backing or a printed ticket. In another
     example, the plurality of 1-D bar-codes may be combined into a single 2-D
     bar-code. The 2-D bar-code may be printed on a single instrument, such as
     a printable media with an adhesive backing or a printed ticket, that may
     be carried by the player. In yet another embodiment, all of the index may
     be combined in a single RFID tag. RFID tags are described in detail with
     respect to FIGS. 9C and 10A-10C.
<BR><BR>[0139] As described above, 1-D/2-D bar-codes may be used with the present
     invention. In an ordinary (1-D) bar-code, the data is encode in a
     vertically redundant format, i.e., the same information is repeated
     vertically. Thus, the heights of the bars may be truncated without any
     loss of information. The vertical redundancy allows a symbol with
     printing defects, such as spots or voids, to still be read. The higher
     the bar heights, the greater probability that at least one path along the
     bar-code will be readable.
<BR><BR>[0140] A 2-D bar-code symbol stores information along the height as well
     as the length of the symbol. Since both dimensions contain information,
     some of the vertical redundancy is lost. To insure accurate reading, most
     2-D bar-codes use check words to insure accurate reading. An advantage of
     a 2-D bar-code symbol is that significantly more data may be encoded than
     compared a 1-D bar-code symbol. With a 2-D bar-code symbol, an entire
     record of a database can be stored on a single 2-D bar-code symbol rather
     than just an index to a record.
<BR><BR>[0141] When a 2-D bar-code is employed, data processing, such as but not
     limited to parsing, editing, formatting, re-ordering, optical character
     recognition, encrypting/decrypting, format conversion, may be utilized to
     process the data read from the 2-D bar-code by the bar-code reader. The
     data processing may be performed by a logic device located in the
     bar-code reader, a logic device in communication with the bar-code reader
     and combinations thereof. Thus, the bar-code reader may include a
     communication interface for communicating with processors located on
     other gaming devices, such as a processor located in a player tracking
     unit, the master gaming controller on the gaming machine or a processor
     on a remote server.
<BR><BR>[0142] A 2-D bar-code is one example of a 2-D symbol encoding format. In
     general there are many types of 2-D symbol formats that may be employed
     with the present invention. Often the term 2-D bar-codes and the term 2-D
     symbols are used interchangeably to describe a 2-D symbol encoding
     information. These 2-D symbol formats include but not are limited to,
     3-DI, ArrayTag, Aztec Code, Small Aztec Code, Codablock, Code 1, Code
     16K, Code 49, CP-Code, DataGlyphs, Data Matrix, Data Strip Code, Dot Code
     A, hueCode, Intacta.Code, MaxiCode, Mini code, PDF 417, Micro PDF 417, QR
     Code, Smart Code, Snowflake Code, Supercode and Ultracode. These codes
     may be black and white codes, i.e., use only black and white elements.
     However, some codes may also utilize color elements or gray scale
     elements which allow the information density encoded in the 2-D symbol to
     be increased. The use of a color elements or gray scale elements in a
     symbol may require different types of scanners to read the symbol than
     are used for symbols encoded only with black and white elements.
<BR><BR>[0143] Varying amounts of data may be encoded in a 2-D symbol depending on
     the format and the capabilities of the reader. Further, in many of the
     formats the data may be encrypted. For instance, Code 16K printed at 7.5
     mils may be used to encode 208 alphabet characters per square inch or 417
     numeric characters per square inch. Data Strip Code may be used to encode
     150 to 1000 Bytes of digital data per square inch. PDF417 (portable data
     format) may be used to encode 1.1 kilobytes of machine readable data in
     the space of a standard bar-code. Also, PDF417 (Symbol Technologies) may
     be used to encode ASCII, numeric or binary data. The data densities may
     vary according encoding format of the data. With maximum error correction
     in PDF417, data may be correctly read from a symbol with half of the
     symbol damaged.
<BR><BR>[0144] The 2-D bar-codes may be used to encode data, text, graphics,
     biometrics, sounds and voice records. For instance, fingerprints, scanned
     signatures and voice authorization records may be stored in a 2-D
     bar-code. The scanned signature and the voice authorization record may be
     recorded at the gaming machine, processed and printed in a 2-D bar-code
     format on a ticket that is carried by the player. The encoded information
     on the ticket may be later used to validate/authenticate the printed
     ticket. In one embodiment, prior to issuing a ticket, the player may be
     asked to speak a short phrase of their choosing or specified by the
     gaming machine into a microphone located on the gaming machine. The short
     phrase may or may not be encoded on the ticket in the player's voice. For
     instance, a digital sound signature may be generated from the message.
     Later, to validate the ticket, the encoded information may be read on the
     ticket and played back to an operator validating the ticket, such via as
     in an earpiece worn by the operator. The operator may ask the player to
     repeat the short phrase encoded on the ticket. The operator may use the
     manner in which the phrase is said, the information contained in the
     phrase or combinations thereof to validate the ticket. In another
     embodiment, the short phrase may be repeated into a microphone and a
     digital sound signature generated from the short phrase may be compared
     with a digital sound signature of the message originally stored on the
     ticket.
<BR><BR>[0145] In other embodiments, the 2-D bar-code may be used to encode a
     record in a loyalty program database such as a 1) a player identification
     number, 2) a social security number, 3) a name, 4) an address, 5) a
     credit number, 6) a player rating, 7) complimentary (comp.) information,
     8) a player preference tracking number and 9) a casino preference
     tracking number. In general, the 2-D barcodes may be used to encode one
     of a) loyalty program information, b) biometric information, c) player
     preferences for games, game features, gaming machine settings, prizes,
     promotions and food/beverage services, d) promotional information, e)
     gaming machine configuration settings, f) prize information, g) cashless
     transaction information and h) and combinations thereof. Further,
     equipment calibrations used for maintenance as well as gaming machine
     settings preferred by the player may be encoded in a 2-D bar-code format.
<BR><BR>[0146] The 2-D bar-codes provide a number of advantages. One advantage is
     that gaming services may be provided to the player when contact with a
     remote server is unavailable because a record rather than an index may be
     encoded in the 2-D bar-code. Another advantage is that the PIN code may
     be eliminated when biometric information is encoded in the 2-D bar-code.
     For instance, in one embodiment, a player's fingerprint may be encoded in
     a 2-D symbol. Thus, rather than entering a PIN number, the player may
     simply place their finger on a finger printer reader. Therefore, the
     player can initiate a secure session without having to remember a PIN
     number.
<BR><BR>[0147] In general, by providing an entire record on the loyalty program
     instrument (e.g., encoded in a 2-D bar-code format or encoded in an RFID
     tag), a gaming service, such as a player tracking session, a preferred
     gaming machine configuration or other customized gaming machine service,
     that requires a record to be retrieved from a remote server to generate
     the service on the gaming machine, may be provided by the gaming machine
     without first contacting the remote server. For example, in a traditional
     player tracking programs, a remote server is contacted after the player
     inserts their player tracking card because the player tracking card only
     stores an index to a record stored on the remote server. Via a
     communication on the gaming machine, the index number is sent to the
     remote server to retrieve the player tracking record corresponding to the
     index number. The player tracking record provides information necessary
     to implement the player tracking session. With the present invention, the
     player tracking session may be implemented using the player tracking
     record stored on the loyalty program instrument without contacting the
     remote server. After the player tracking session has been completed, the
     gaming machine may contact the remote server to provide a history of the
     player tracking session that has been implemented on the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0148] Bar-code readers include a bar-code scanner and a decoder. The
     bar-code scanner is the optoelectronic part of the reader which
     transforms for the optical image of the bar-code into electrical signals.
     The electrical signal may be converted by a decoder within the reader
     into ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). The
     readers of the present invention are not limited to reading data only
     encoded in a 1-D bar-code format (there are also a wide variety of 1-D
     formats). For instance, information on a loyalty program instrument may
     be encoded in a 1-D bar-code format, a 2-D bar-code format (there are
     wide variety of 2-D bar-code symbol formats), other symbol formats,
     alpha-numeric formats and combinations thereof. Therefore, the reader of
     the present invention, including a scanner and a decoder, may be capable
     of scanning and decoding information encoded in a wide variety of
     formats. For instance, on a substrate 900, a casino's name in an
     alpha-numeric format, a symbol for a casino, a 1-D bar-code and a 2-D
     bar-code may all be printed on the same substrate and all of this
     information in the different formats may be processed by the same reader.
<BR><BR>[0149] The bar-code reader may be used to read 1-D bar-codes and 2-D
     bar-codes using a laser scanner. The laser scanner used in the bar-code
     reader is one example of a non-physical data interface. The laser in the
     scanner may be generated using a laser diode. The wavelength of the light
     used in the scanner may vary from the visible to the infrared spectrum.
     In some embodiments, the bar-code may be printed in an invisible format.
     For example, some invisible inks and dyes are fluorescent in the near
     infrared spectrum and thus may be read with infrared scanner. These
     symbols are not visible under UV light.
<BR><BR>[0150] The scanning rate for the laser scanner may be between 40 and 800
     times a second. Since self-scanning laser readers, scan at a high rate,
     they are able to read poorly printed bar code that may require several
     scan attempts without the user noticing. Many bar-code readers and
     symbols formats provide for error correction that allow for damaged or
     misprinted symbols to be read. Typically, laser scanner use coherent
     light, which limits the amount of beam spreading. This allows the
     diameter of the beam to remain small enough to resolve wide and narrow
     bars of the bar-code even when the reading distances vary over the
     bar-code symbol. This property allows bar-codes printed on curved
     surfaces to be read. Depending on the symbol width, printing technology
     and ambient conditions, data may be read from bar-codes in a range of
     about 2 inches to 30 inches from the reader. These distances may vary
     depending on the employed technology. For instance, an ArrayTag 2-D
     bar-code format may be read from a distance as great as 50 meters.
<BR><BR>[0151] Another example of a non-physical contact data interface that may
     be used to read 1-D and 2-D bar-codes in a bar-code reader is a charged
     coupled device (CCD) scanner. In CCD scanner, the bar-code may be
     illuminated by a photoflash or by another type of light source. The image
     of the bar-code is focused on to an array of photodetectors (i.e., CCD).
     The images of the dark bars of the symbol will fall on some of the
     photodetectors, while the light spaces fall on other detectors. An
     electrical signal is applied to the CCD array and the light value at each
     detector is read. This signal may be processed to determine the
     information encoded in the symbol. With a bright light, the depth of
     focus for a CCD array is several inches and generally the symbol must be
     placed closer to the scanner as compared to a laser scanner. Although,
     depending on the size of the symbols, the information may be read up to
     several feet away.
<BR><BR>[0152] The density of the symbol that can be read is a function of the
     number of photodetectors in the CCD array. Instead of a CCD scanner, a
     CCD video camera may be also be used to read bar-code symbols. The laser
     and CCD scanners may be operated continuously, may be activated when a
     sensor detects an object is in the vicinity of the scanner, may be
     activated in response to a gaming event, such as a player depositing
     money into a gaming machine and combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0153] In the present invention, a loyalty program instrument with an RFID
     tag is another type of device that may be utilized with an input
     mechanism using a non-physical contact data interface. In FIG. 9C, a
     substrate 900 with an embedded RFID tag 906 is shown. In its simplest
     form, an RFID tag 906 may comprise a logic device 907 and an antenna 908
     without a power supply. When the RFID tag without a power supply is
     interrogated by a RFID tag reader operating at the right radio frequency,
     the antenna picks up a small amount of electromagnetic energy that is
     used to power logic device 907. After receiving power, the logic device
     907 broadcasts via the antenna 908 data that is stored in the logic
     device to the RFID tag reader. Additional details regarding RFID tag
     readers and RFID tags are described with respect to FIGS. 10A-10C.
<BR><BR>[0154] The RFID tags 906 may be of varying sizes. For instance, the logic
     device 907 may be 1 mm square and 1/2 mm thick and embedded in a flexible
     substrate such as paper. The RFID devices may also incorporated into a
     substrate 900 with an adhesive backing and placed on various objects
     carried by a gaming machine user at the casino in the manner as was
     described for the 1-D/2-D bar-codes. RFID devices that may be used with
     the present invention are produced by companies, such as Texas
     Instruments (Dallas, Tex.), Hitachi (Japan), Infeon Technologies
     (Germany). Another type of RFID tag by Samoff (Princeton, N.J.) is as
     small as 250 micrometers wide. The RFID tag includes photocells, logic,
     memory for 50 bits and an antenna etched in silicon. The logic device
     receives power through a burst of laser light that is received by the
     photocells.
<BR><BR>[0155] The memory storage capacities of the RFID tags used in the present
     invention may vary. In one embodiment, the RFID tag may be used to store
     a number that is an index to record in database like a 1-D bar-code
     symbol. In another embodiment, the RFID tag may be used to store a record
     in a database like the 2-D bar-code symbol. The type of information, such
     as loyalty program instrument data, that may be stored on the RFID tag
     906 are the same as described above for the 1-D/2-D bar-codes.
<BR><BR>[0156] In one embodiment of the present invention, a combination of
     1-D/2-D bar-codes and RFID tags may be used. In FIG. 9D, a substrate 900
     including an RFID tag 906, 1-D bar-code symbol 902 and a 2-D bar-code
     symbol 904 is shown. The RFID tag 906 may be embedded in a media, such as
     paper or plastic, and the 1-D/2-D barcodes may be printed on the media.
     In particular embodiments, the media may be credit card size plastic
     substrate, a thermal printing media with an embedded RFID tag, any type
     of printable media with an embedded RFID tag and a printable label with
     an embedded RFID tag and an adhesive backing. Since the RFID tags may be
     quite small a plurality of tags may be embedded in the same media. Input
     mechanisms of the present invention may be designed to read information
     stored in RFID tags, read bar-codes or read both formats. For instance, a
     bill validator may be capable of scanning information encoded in the
     1-D/2-D bar-code formats printed on a ticket inserted in the bill
     validator and interrogating an RFID tag embedded in the inserted ticket.
<BR><BR>[0157] In FIG. 9D, the different information formats (i.e., RFID and
     bar-code) may be stored the same information or different information.
     For instance, in one embodiment, the 1-D bar-code 902 may store an index
     to a record while the RFID tag 906 stores a security code that is used to
     validate the instrument. In another embodiment, the RFID tag and a 1-D
     bar-code may be used to store the same index number. Thus, if the RFID
     tag is damage, the index number may be read from the 1-D bar-code or if
     the 1-D bar-code is damaged the index number may be read from the RFID
     tag.
<BR><BR>[0158] FIGS. 10A-10C are block diagrams of RFID tags and RFID tag readers
     of the present invention. In FIGS. 10A and 10B, the use of inductive
     coupling and propagation coupling to read RFID tags. In FIG. 10C, an RFID
     tag for one embodiment of the present invention is described.
<BR><BR>[0159] In FIG. 10A, a reader antenna 912 connected to a reader/programmer
     910 is used to communicate with an RFID tag 908, including a logic device
     907 and antenna 908, which is located on a substrate 900. The RFID tag
     906 is a passive RFID tag and does not include a power supply. Although,
     as described with respect to FIG. 10C, active RFID tags with a power
     supply may be used in the present invention. The logic device may be a
     silicon microprocessor, which may vary in size. The antenna is typically
     a metal coil made of a conductive metal such as copper or aluminum.
<BR><BR>[0160] Power is supplied to the RFID tag 906 via the air interface 914
     through inductive coupling 915 to the metal coil which is the tag's
     antenna 908. Inductive RFID tags are powered by a magnetic field
     generated by the reader. The antenna 908 picks up magnetic energy. The
     magnetic energy is then used to power the logic device 907. The logic
     device 907 modulates the magnetic field in order to retrieve and transmit
     data back to the reader 910. The data transmitted back to the reader then
     may be communicated to another gaming device, such as but not limited to,
     a logic device on a player tracking unit, a master gaming controller on a
     gaming machine and a remote server.
<BR><BR>[0161] An RFID tag using capacitive coupling or propagation coupling 916
     is shown in FIG. 10B. In a typical RFID tag using propagation coupling,
     the logic device 907 is a silicon microprocessor. The RFID tag's antenna
     908 is generated using a conductive ink. By printing the antenna
     structure on a media, such as paper, using the conductive ink, the
     antenna may be formed. Carbon-ink electrodes on the paper, which may be
     integrated into an adhesive label, may be used to connect the antenna to
     the microprocessor. The capacitively coupled RFID tag 906 is powered by
     electric fields generated by the reader antenna 912 attached to the
     reader/programmer 910.
<BR><BR>[0162] In another embodiment of the present invention, the RFID tag 906
     may include one or more photocells. The photocells may be used to power
     the RFID tag by shining light energy, such as a generated by a laser,
     onto the photocell. The photocell then transmits the energy received from
     the laser to the logic device.
<BR><BR>[0163] Typically, the RFID tags may use three frequency ranges, low,
     medium and high to communicate information. Low frequency range is from
     100-500 Khz. The medium frequency range is from 10-15 Mhz and the high
     frequency range is from 850-850 Mhz and 2.4 to 5.8 GHz. In general, the
     reading speed for data and the reading range increases as the frequency
     used with the RFID tag increases. The range of the RFID system is a
     function of the power available at the reader/programmer 910 and the
     power available by the RFID tag to respond and the environmental
     conditions in which the RFID tag is used, such as a casino environment.
<BR><BR>[0164] The function of the reader portion of the reader/programmer 910 is
     to provide a means of communicating with the tags and facilitating data
     transfer. The reader may include a logic device designed to perform
     signal conditioning and parity error checking and correction. RFID
     readers, such as 910, may probe simultaneously a plurality of RFID tags.
     Once a signal from an RFID tag has been correctly received and decoded,
     algorithms may be applied to decide whether the signal is a repeat
     transmission. When the reader 910 determines the transmission has been
     repeated, the reader may instruct the RFID tag to stop transmitting. This
     process, often referred to as "Command Response Protocol," is used to
     circumvent the problem of reading multiple tags in a short period of time
     during batch processing. In another approach, the reader 910 may look for
     RFID tags with specific identities and interrogate them in turn.
<BR><BR>[0165] Batch processing may be applied when a plurality of RFID tags are
     within the range of the RFID reader. For example, batch processing may be
     applied when a player is carrying a plurality of instruments where each
     instrument may include one or more RFID tags. In this example, the reader
     may be able to interrogate each of the RFID tags to determine the
     function of each instrument carried by the player. In one embodiment,
     when the player is carrying a plurality of RFID tags where a portion of
     the RFID tags encode index numbers corresponding to different player
     tracking programs, then the RFID reader located on the gaming machine may
     be able to read each of the index numbers stored on the tags and
     determine if any of the read index numbers are valid for a player
     tracking program implemented on the gaming machine. The interrogation of
     the different RFID tags by the reader may be initiated when a game play
     session is initiated on the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0166] In one embodiment, the player may carry instruments with RFID tags
     issued for a number of purposes, such as player tracking programs,
     anonymous loyalty instruments, cashless instruments, promotional credits,
     coupons and comps. These RFID tags may have been issued at different
     locations and at different times. Thus, the RFID tags may store
     information regarding but not limited to, a purpose, where they were
     issued, the time they were issued and when they expire. When a game play
     session is initiated on the gaming machine by a player or in response to
     some other game event, the reader may interrogate the RFID tags that are
     within range of the reader such as the RFID tags carried by the player
     initiating the game play session. With this information, the gaming
     machine may be able to determine 1) what types of tags the player is
     carrying, 2) what is their purpose and 3) where the player has been. The
     gaming machine may also be able to determine where the RFID tag was
     issued, when the instrument with the RFID tag was issued and whether the
     instrument has an expiration date. This process may be carried out at
     other locations frequented by the player. For instance, RFID readers may
     be located at cashier stations, ATM machines, casino kiosk, hotel
     registration desks as well as gaming machines.
<BR><BR>[0167] Using information read from RFID tags carried by the player, a
     gaming device, such as a gaming machine, or a casino employee that has
     access to the read information, may send targeted information to the
     player. For instance, if the player is carrying a coupon for promotional
     credits, the gaming machine may remind the player of the coupon and
     encourage them to use it. In another embodiment, if the gaming machine
     determines the player is carrying cashless instruments with a cash value
     above a certain threshold, then the gaming machine may offer the player
     promotional offers to entice them to spend it. The promotional offer may
     be displayed on a display screen on the gaming machine or may be made via
     a printed ticket issued by the gaming machine. In another embodiment,
     based upon information read from the RFID tags, such as the value of
     cashless instruments carried by the player, the gaming machine may notify
     an attendant to provide the player special service.
<BR><BR>[0168] In another embodiment, if the gaming machine determines that any of
     the instruments carried by the player are about to expire, the gaming
     machine may generate and display a notification message. For instance,
     cashless instruments are only redeemable for a limited time period. Thus,
     if the gaming machine determines that a cashless instrument is about to
     expire, the gaming machine may generate a notification message with this
     information and display the message. In another example, promotions, such
     as promotional credits, may only be valid for a limited time period.
     Therefore, if the gaming machine determines the promotion is about to
     end, then the gaming machine may generate a notification message with
     this information and display the message.
<BR><BR>[0169] The targeted services may be provided while identity of the player
     is unknown. targeted anonymous gaming services are possible because
     although the RFID tags may not contain any information about the player's
     identity, information read from a plurality of RFID tags carried by the
     player, such as the purpose of the instrument, when they were issued and
     where they were issued, may provide enough information to target a
     service to the player. As described above, information read from the
     instruments the player is carrying may be used to construct a history of
     the player's recent activities and based upon the information software
     algorithms may be developed that target services to the player.
<BR><BR>[0170] A person carrying the RFID tags may not know what information is
     stored on the tags or in what instruments the tags are located. Further,
     the information on the RFID tags may be gathered without any active
     participation by a person carrying the RFID tag, i.e., the information
     gathering process is passive in regards to participation by the player.
     Passive information gathering is not possible with a magnetic striped
     card. With a magnetic striped card, active information gathering is
     required because the player has to correctly insert the card into a card
     reader to have the information from the card read. Further, only the
     information on the inserted card is read. Information from other magnetic
     striped cards carried by the player can't be read unless the player
     serially inserts the card in the card reader. With an RFID tag (see FIGS.
     12 and 13 for more detail), the player may only have to be in a location
     within the range of the RFID reader to have the information on all the
     RFID tags they are carrying to be read.
<BR><BR>[0171] Returning to FIGS. 10A and 10B, the reader/programmer 910 may be
     used to store information to an RFID tag 906. In one embodiment, the
     programming process may involve a write-once read many (WORM) RFID tag.
     For this type of tag, the information programming may be carried out when
     the instrument with the RFID tag is issued. For example, a printable
     media with an embedded RFID tag may be programmed by the
     reader/programmer 910 during the process of generating a printed ticket
     with the RFID tag. In another embodiment, the embedded RFID tag may be
     pre-programmed and the information stored on RFID tag may only be read
     when the printed ticket is issued. The data read from the RFD tag may be
     stored in a database located on one of the gaming machine, a remote
     server and combinations thereof. As described with respect to FIG. 10C,
     more complicated RFID tags may be read/write capable, i.e., the memory on
     the tags may be written to and over written a plurality of times.
<BR><BR>[0172] In one embodiment of the present invention, a portion or all of the
     electronic circuitry for an RFID tag used in an instrument may be
     generated by printing the circuitry directly to a printable media. The
     printing process may be carried out by a printer located in a gaming
     device, such as a gaming machine as part of the process of issuing the
     instrument from the gaming machine. For example, circuitry may be printed
     on a cashless instrument when the cashless instrument is issued from the
     gaming machine. The circuitry may be used to store information about the
     cashless instrument, such as a value of the ticket.
<BR><BR>[0173] In one embodiment, the printed circuitry may be memory circuitry
     used to store information used on the RFID tag 906. The printed circuitry
     may be generated when the instrument is issued i.e., "on the fly." As an
     example, the memory circuitry may be generated using conductive ink
     transferred to a suitable media, such as paper, using an inkjet printer.
     Paper is one example of a flexible media that may be used with the
     present invention. In another example, a thermal printer may be used to
     activate electronic pathways on a thermally activated media to create the
     electronic circuitry. The memory circuitry printed on the media used for
     the instrument may be capable of storing a number of bits of information,
     such as an index number for a loyalty program instrument. The memory
     circuitry may be connected to an RFID microprocessor embedded in the
     printable media, such as the logic device 907. Therefore, the stored
     information in the memory circuitry may be later read by an RFID reader
     910.
<BR><BR>[0174] The printers used in the present invention may also be capable of
     printing information, such as loyalty program instrument data, in other
     formats, such as 1-D/2-D bar-codes and alpha-numeric symbols, as
     described with respect to FIGS. 9A-9D. The printer may be one of a laser
     printer, inkjet printer and thermal contact printer. Further, the printer
     may be capable of printing information, such as a bar-code symbols, in an
     invisible format.
<BR><BR>[0175] In FIG. 10C, a RFID tag 906 for one embodiment of the present
     invention is described. The RFID tags of the present invention may be
     passive or active tags. Active tags are powered by an internal battery
     and are typically read/write devices. Passive tags operate without an
     internal battery source, deriving the power to operate from the field
     generated by the reader.
<BR><BR>[0176] The RFID tag memory may comprise one or more of ROM 924,
     Non-volatile memory 922 (e.g., EEPROM or flash memory) and RAM 926. The
     ROM memory may be used to accommodate security data and the RFID tag
     operating system instructions. The operating system instructions may be
     used by the logic device 920 to perform internal functions, such as
     response delay timing, data flow control, encryption/decryption and power
     supply switching. The RAM memory 926 may be used for temporary data
     storage during interrogation and response between the RFID tag 906 and
     the reader 910.
<BR><BR>[0177] The NV-RAM is used to store RFID tag data. NV-RAM is used to ensure
     the RFID tag data is not lost when the device is in its quiescent or
     power-saving sleep state. The NV-RAM used in the present invention may
     vary in storage capacity. The NV-RAM may be capable of storing a number
     of bits of information used to store a number that is an index to a
     record in a database or may be large enough to store a portable data file
     which may be a record in a database. As described with respect to FIGS.
     9A-9D, gaming services may be provided using the record stored in a
     portable data file without contacting a remote server.
<BR><BR>[0178] The data transfer circuitry 926 may be used as a data buffer to
     temporarily hold incoming data following demodulation and outgoing data
     for modulation and may be used to interface with the reader antenna. The
     data transfer circuitry 926 may also be used to direct and accommodate
     the interrogation field energy for powering purposes and triggering of
     the transponder response. Circuitry (not shown) may also be provided to
     allow for programming of the RFID tag 906. The power supply 930 is
     optional. Active tags require a power supply while passive tags derive
     power remote sources such as the from field energy provided by the reader
     antenna or a laser light source used to transfer energy to the tag via a
     photocell.
<BR><BR>[0179] FIGS. 11A-11B are block diagrams of input mechanisms with a
     non-physical contact data interface of the present invention. The input
     mechanisms are provided for illustrative purposes and the present
     invention is not limited to these two designs. The input mechanisms may
     be mounted directly to a gaming machine or may be located within a player
     tracking device mounted to the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0180] In FIG. 11A, an input mechanism 950 with an interior non-physical
     contact data interface 952 is shown. The non-physical contact data
     interface 952 may be one of a bar-code scanner, a RFID tag reader and
     combinations thereof. The input mechanism 950 comprises a rectangular
     housing 955. The rectangular housing has an exterior surface 959 that is
     designed to form an exterior surface of the gaming machine. Thus, most of
     the housing 955 is located within the interior of the gaming machine. The
     exterior surface 959 may be located on a horizontal surface, a vertical
     surface or on a surface with an inclination between horizontal and
     vertical located on the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0181] The housing 955 is designed for accepting a rectangular substrate
     900, such as a ticket or a plastic card. The substrate 900 may include
     1-D bar-codes 902, 2-D bar-codes 904, RFID tags (not shown) and
     combinations thereof. The exterior surface 959 includes a slot 956. The
     slot is designed to receive the substrate 900. Guides 958 may be located
     in the interior of the housing. The guides 958 may be used to constrain
     the orientation of the substrate 900 after it is inserted in the slot
     956. The top of the non-physical contact data interface 952 may be
     located at a distance below the guides 958. After the substrate 900 is
     inserted in the slot, information on the substrate may be read by the
     non-physical contact data interface 952.
<BR><BR>[0182] In FIG. 11B, an input mechanism 951 with an exterior mounted
     non-physical contact data interface 952. The top of the non-physical
     contact data interface 952 is surrounded by an exterior surface 960. The
     non-physical contact data interface 952 may be mounted below a
     translucent material. The non-physical contact data interface 952 and the
     exterior surface by connected to a housing (not shown) extending below
     the exterior surface 960. The exterior surface 959 may be located on a
     horizontal surface, a vertical surface or on a surface with an
     inclination between horizontal and vertical located on the gaming
     machine.
<BR><BR>[0183] The non-physical contact data interface may read information from
     the substrate 900 when it is moved through or within an active volume 970
     above the reader 952. The shape and size of the substrate 900 is not
     limited to a rectangular shape shown in the figure. Information may be
     read from the substrate 900 at one of a plurality of distances between
     the substrate 900 and the reader 952 and with one of a plurality of
     orientations between the substrate 900 and the reader. For example, when
     bar-code data is read from the substrate 900 using a bar-code reader, the
     side of the substrate 900 facing the top of the reader 952 may be
     parallel to the top of the reader or inclined at one of a plurality
     relative to the top of the reader. When RFID data is read from the
     substrate 900, in some embodiments, the RFID data may be read
     independently of the orientation of the substrate relative to the reader
     952. In other embodiments, when the RFID tag receives power from the
     reader 952 via light energy received from photocells on the tag, the
     substrate may have to be oriented in one of a plurality of orientations
     that allows the photocells to receive light energy from the reader 952.
<BR><BR>[0184] During the read process, the substrate 900 may be stationary or at
     a time varying position relative to the reader 952. Further, the
     orientation of the substrate relative to the reader 952 during the read
     process may be fixed or may be time varying during the read process. For
     example, for a substrate 900 with a 2-D bar-code, the substrate 900 may
     be moving and changing orientation in the volume above the reader 952
     during reading as the reader 952 scans the 2-D bar-code on the substrate
     a plurality of times.
<BR><BR>[0185] The input mechanism 951 may optionally include guides 962 for
     aligning the substrate 900 in a preferred orientation. By placing the
     substrate 900 within the guides, the substrate 900 may be aligned
     relative to the reader 952. If the substrate 900 is placed above the
     guides, but somewhat aligned with the guides or the substrate 900 is
     smaller than the guides, the substrate may still be sufficiently aligned.
     In one embodiment, the guides 962 may include slots for inserting the
     substrate 900. An advantage of using a "free" read where the substrate
     900 is simply placed within the active volume 970 for the read and then
     removed that the substrate 900 can't be left in the device like a
     magnetic striped card can be left in a card slot. Therefore, this design
     may reduce the probability of the substrate 900 being lost.
<BR><BR>[0186] The input mechanisms 950 and 951 may include a loyalty program
     session status interface comprising one of a status light 954, a sound
     projection device 955 and combinations thereof. The light may be located
     at any location on the exterior surfaces 959 and 960. For input mechanism
     950, the light may be a strip with one or more lighting elements and may
     surround the slot. For input mechanism, the light may be a strip with one
     or more lighting elements. Further, the guides 962 may be translucent and
     back-lit. The sound device 955 may be located on the exterior surfaces
     959 and 960. The sound device 955 and status light 954 may be located or
     at other locations on the gaming machine and are not limited to exterior
     surfaces 959 and 960. In general, the sound device 955 and status light
     954 may be used to provide information regarding the functioning of the
     input mechanisms in 950 and 951 in any application for which they are
     used.
<BR><BR>[0187] The loyalty session status interface may be used to indicate the
     status of a loyalty program session and communicate information regarding
     the loyalty program session. In the present invention, the loyalty
     program session is not limited to being initiated by physical contact
     between the loyalty program instrument and the instrument reader and is
     not limited to being terminated by the removal of a card from a card
     slot. The loyalty program session may be initiated and terminated in
     response to a number of conditions. For example, the loyalty program
     session may be initiated by a first gaming event and may be terminated by
     a second gaming event. The first gaming event may be one of i) an input
     of loyalty program instrument data from the loyalty point instrument via
     the non-physical contact data interface, ii) a deposit of an indicia of
     credit into the gaming machine, iii) an insertion of a card into a card
     slot on the gaming machine, iv) an activation an input button on the
     gaming machine, v) an input of a loyalty program instrument into the
     input mechanism on the gaming machine, vi) an input of a code into the
     gaming machine, vii) an input of biometric information into the gaming
     machine and viii) combinations thereof. The second gaming event may be
     one of a) an occurrence of zero credits on the gaming machine, b) an
     amount of idle time on the gaming machine exceeding a specified limit, c)
     a tilt condition, d) an error condition, e) a request for a loyalty
     program instrument, f) a request to terminate the loyalty program
     session, g) an inability to detect the loyalty program instrument, h) a
     cashout request, i) a timeout condition, j) an inability to detect a user
     of the gaming machine and k) combinations thereof.
<BR><BR>[0188] The loyalty program session status interface may communicate that
     status information in a loyalty program session in a number of ways. The
     sound projection device 955 may emit a sound in response to a data read
     by the non-physical contact data interface 952 or the lighting device 955
     may generate light in response to a data read by the non-physical contact
     data interface 952. The lighting device 954 may change color in response
     to a data read by the non-physical contact data interface. For example,
     the lighting device 954 may generate one of a first color, first light
     pattern and combinations thereof when a status of the loyalty program
     session is active and may generate one of a second color, a second light
     pattern and combinations thereof when the status of the loyalty program
     session is inactive. Further, the lighting device may generate one of a
     third color, a third light pattern and combinations thereof when the
     status of the loyalty program session is about to change. For example, a
     loyalty program session may time-out after a period of time and the third
     pattern of light may be generated in a time period just before the
     loyalty program session ends.
<BR><BR>[0189] When loyalty program session status interface includes both a sound
     device and one or more lighting devices. The loyalty program session
     status interface may generate one of a sound, a light pattern, a light
     color and combinations thereof when data is read correctly by the
     non-physical contact data interface and may generate one of a sound, a
     light pattern, a light color and combinations thereof when data is read
     incorrectly by the non-physical contact data interface. The loyalty
     program session status interface may generate one of a sound, a light
     pattern, a light color and combinations thereof when a status of the
     loyalty program session is active, may generate one of a sound, a light
     pattern, a light color and combinations thereof when a status of the
     loyalty program session is inactive and may generate one of a sound, a
     light pattern, a light color and combinations thereof when a status of
     the loyalty program session is about to change.
<BR><BR>[0190] FIG. 12 is a block diagram of foot prints of non-physical contact
     data interfaces of the present invention. The gaming machine typically
     occupies a foot-print 970 while the gaming machine is on the casino
     floor. The foot print is the area on the casino floor occupied by the
     gaming machine which may vary according to the make and model of the
     gaming machine. To play the gaming machine, a player typically stands or
     sits within a game player area 976 in front of the gaming machine. To
     read bar-code data, a substrate with the bar-code is placed within an
     active volume of space in which the bar-code reader is operable to read
     data. A foot print 974 for the active volume of the bar-code reader is
     shown. The active volume is typically located at a location on the gaming
     machine that is easily accessible to the player that is located within
     the game playing area 976.
<BR><BR>[0191] An RFID tag reader may generate an active volume with a much larger
     foot print than a bar-code reader. In one embodiment, the foot print of
     the active volume for an RFID tag reader may encompass all or a large
     portion of the game playing area 976. The RFID tag reader may be designed
     to read all of the RFID tags located within its active volume. A foot
     print 972 for one active volume of an RFID tag reader is shown in the
     figure. For the foot print 972, when a player carrying RFID tags is
     located within the game playing area 976, then the RFID tag reader may be
     able to read the RFID tags carried by the player.
<BR><BR>[0192] The active volume of the RFID tag reader may be sized to prevent
     overlapping reads. For instance, when the RFID tag reader is capable of
     reading an RFID tag storing loyalty program instrument data that is used
     to initiate a loyalty program session and when the active volume is large
     an extends beyond the game playing area 976, the RFID tag reader may read
     loyalty program instruments carried by a plurality of different game
     players. For instance, the RFID tag reader may read RFID tags carried by
     two different game players playing games on adjacent gaming machines in a
     casino. As another example, a person carrying an RFID tag used as a
     loyalty program instrument not participating in a game play on a gaming
     machine may be located proximate to a person with an RFID tag used as a
     loyalty program instrument that is participating in a game play session.
<BR><BR>[0193] To minimize overlapping reads, the active volume of the RFID tag
     reader may be shaped. The active volume may be shaped by among other
     factors, the size of the antenna used with the reader, the power supplied
     to the antenna and the frequency used to read the RFID tags. Further,
     shielding may be built into the cabinet of the gaming machine to limit
     the active volume of the RFID tag reader. For instance, shielding may be
     provided to prevent the active volume from extending behind the gaming
     machine or to the sides of the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0194] Dynamically changing the active volume may be used to located RFID
     tags closest to an RFID reader. For instance, if the active volume of the
     reader is such that a plurality of different RFID tags carried by
     different players are read by the reader, then the signal strength
     supplied to the reader antenna may be reduced such that only the RFID
     tags closest to the RFID reader receive enough power to reply to the RFID
     reader. Thus, only the RFID tag for a player located proximate to the
     front of the gaming machine may be read as the power supplied to the
     reader antenna is reduced. This approach may be applied when it is
     desirable to eliminate overlapping reads.
<BR><BR>[0195] In some instances, it may be desirable to determine to location of
     an RFID tag. For instance, it may be desirable to determine the location
     of the RFID tag proximate to a particular gaming machine or the location
     of an RFID tag within a casino. Methods and apparatus for locating
     wireless gaming devices, such as RFID tags in a wireless gaming
     environment are described with respect to FIG. 13.
<BR><BR>[0196] FIG. 13 is a block diagram of a gaming system providing wireless
     data access and wireless gaming device location services. In one
     embodiment, the gaming system is a wireless loyalty program instrument
     network 999. However, the present invention is not limited to locating
     wireless gaming devices used as loyalty program instruments. Any wireless
     gaming device capable of communication with the gaming system, such as
     cell phones and personal communication devices with wireless interfaces,
     used for any purpose may be located with the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0197] The gaming system may comprise a plurality of wireless signal
     generators/receivers, such as RFID tag readers that are used to
     interrogate wireless gaming devices such as RFID tags and more complex
     RFID enabled devices, such as cell phones and other portable
     communication devices. The gaming system may also include a plurality of
     wireless access points to a local area network for active communication
     sessions with the more complex RFID devices that may transmit and receive
     data at higher data bandwidths. The wireless access points may provide
     sufficient bandwidth for services involving voice, video, internet
     connections, text messaging, e-mail and game services that may be
     provided on the more complex RFID devices. The wireless signal receivers
     and wireless access points may be located in gaming devices such as
     gaming machines 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004 and 1005. The wireless
     signal generators/receivers and wireless access points may be located in
     locations separate from the gaming machines, such as wireless signal
     generator/receiver 1007 and wireless access point 1006. In one
     embodiment, the wireless signal receivers used to locate wireless gaming
     devices may be totally separate from the gaming machines in that the
     gaming machines do not include wireless signal receivers.
<BR><BR>[0198] The wireless signal generator/receivers and wireless access points
     are connected via a network 1012 to a location manager 1010. The location
     manager may be used to process signals received from a plurality of
     signal receivers in communication with the location manger 1010 and use
     information received from the plurality of readers to determine the
     location of a wireless source. The wireless sources may be RFID tags,
     cell phones or any type of device with a wireless communication
     interface.
<BR><BR>[0199] The wireless sources may be used as loyalty program instruments.
     The wireless sources generate signals that may be received by a number of
     different signal receivers. In the case of a passive RFID device, until a
     signal is received from a reader device, the signals from the passive
     devices are not generated because the signal from the reader device is
     used to supply power to the wireless source to generate its reply signal.
     For active RFID devices with an internal power source, the initial signal
     may be provided by the wireless source.
<BR><BR>[0200] As an example of how location services may be provided in gaming
     environment three passive RFID tags used as loyalty program instruments,
     1014, 1016 and 1018, are shown in FIG. 13. The example is provided for
     illustrative purposes only. In one scenario, a game play session is
     initiated on gaming machine 1000. A player carrying the RFID tag 1016 may
     initiate the game play session. A player carrying the RFID tag 1018 may
     be involved in a game play session on an adjacent gaming machine and a
     third person walking near the gaming machine may be carrying the RFID tag
     1014.
<BR><BR>[0201] When the game play session is initiated, an RFID reader on gaming
     machine 1000 broadcasts a signal. The range of the signal is large enough
     to be received by RFID tags 1014, 1016 and 1018. In response to its
     initial signal, the RFID reader receives response signals from each of
     the RFID tags, 1014, 1016 and 1018, which are used as loyalty program
     instruments. In one embodiment, the gaming machine may be able to
     eliminate one or more of the loyalty program instruments based upon
     information read from the loyalty program instrument. For instance, one
     or more the loyalty program instruments may be issued for loyalty
     programs that are not valid on the gaming machine 1000. Thus, the gaming
     machine may be able to eliminate the RFID tags that are not valid on the
     gaming machine. In another embodiment, the gaming machine may be able to
     determine the closest loyalty program instruments to the gaming machine
     based upon the signal strength received from the tag or based upon a time
     to receive the signal reply signal from each of the RFID tags. Thus, when
     it is assumed that the RFID tags closest to the gaming machine are
     carried by the player initiating the game play session, the RFID tags
     that are farther away may be eliminated. Further, the gaming machine may
     reduce the power that is supplied to its reader antenna, such that, only
     the RFID tags closest to the gaming machine will receive enough power to
     generate a reply to the gaming machine. Thus, eliminating the RFID tags
     that are farthest away.
<BR><BR>[0202] In one embodiment, for the case where two or more valid loyalty
     program instruments have been detected, the gaming machine may simply
     display a list of names corresponding to the index numbers read from each
     of the detected instruments, prompt the player to verify their name and
     input a pin number corresponding to the index number for their name. When
     a PIN number is correctly received by the gaming machine corresponding to
     the selected loyalty program instrument, then the loyalty program session
     may be initiated on the gaming machine.
<BR><BR>[0203] In other embodiments, it may be desirable to more precisely locate,
     each of the RFID tags. This type of service may be applied to different
     types of wireless device, such as cell phones. In one example, the gaming
     machine 1000 may send a message to the location manager requesting a
     location of an RFID tag. In response, the location manager 1010 may send
     a message to a plurality of nearby wireless signal receivers requesting
     each of them to turn on their receivers and may send a message to request
     the RFID reader in gaming machine 1000 to send out a signal or a pattern
     of signals that may be received by the RFID tags where the signal
     strength generated by the reader may be varied. As example, in response
     to the signal from the reader in gaming machine 1000, the RFID tag 1014
     may generate a signal that is received by the wireless access point 1006,
     gaming machine 1001 and gaming machine 1000. Further, the RFID tag 1016
     may generate a signal that is received by the gaming machine 1000, gaming
     machine 1001 and gaming machine 1003. In addition RFID tag 1018 may send
     a signal that is received by gaming machines 1000, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005
     and the signal generator/receiver 1007.
<BR><BR>[0204] The gaming devices receiving the signals may send response
     information to the location manager 1010 regarding when they received the
     signals and the signal strength. In addition, the location manager 1010
     may request one or more other readers located on different gaming devices
     to send out a signal and a again request the nearby gaming devices to
     listen for the reply signal and relay this information to the location
     manager 1010.
<BR><BR>[0205] Using the received information, the location may apply an
     algorithm, such as triangulation, to determine the location of each of
     the RFID tags. For instance, the location may be the location of the RFID
     tag relative to a casino floor plan. To provide this location, the
     location manager 1010 may store a map of the casino floor plan and the
     position of each signal receiver on the casino floor. After determining
     the location of each of the RFID tags, the location manager 1010 may send
     a message to the gaming machine 1000 with information indicating which
     RFID tag is closest to the gaming machine. In response to this
     information, the gaming machine 1000 may initiate a loyalty program
     session with the closest RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0206] The location manager 1010 may be capable of providing location
     services that are of varying accuracies. For instance, in some
     embodiments, it may be desirable to locate one or more RFID tags within a
     particular area, such as in the vicinity of a bank of gaming machines.
     This may be useful for monitoring traffic in the casino. In other
     embodiments, it may be desirable to more precisely pin-point the location
     of a particular RFID tag, such as its distance from a particular gaming
     machine. In some embodiments, the resolution of the location service may
     be accurate to less than 3-4 feet. The required resolution may depend on
     the dimensions of the gaming machines and their spacing on the casino
     floor. In another embodiment, the resolution may be accurate enough to
     determine whether a location of the wireless gaming device is directly in
     front of a gaming machine. To locate a wireless gaming device in front of
     a gaming machine may require a resolution accuracy of about 11/2 feet or
     less.
<BR><BR>[0207] The location manager 1010 may also keep a record of a status of
     each of the wireless activities involving wireless gaming devices and the
     locations of these devices. This information may be used to simplify the
     location process. For instance, the location manager 1010 may store a
     record that the RFID tag 1018 has been used to initiate a loyalty program
     session on gaming machine 1003. If the loyalty program session using RFID
     tag 1018 is still in session when an attempt is made on gaming machine
     1000 to start a loyalty program session using RFID tag 1016, then the
     location manager 1010 may be able to eliminate RFID tag 1018 as the RFID
     tag that is to be used to initiate a loyalty program session on gaming
     machine 1000. In other embodiments, the location manager 1010 may assign
     communication frequencies for different RFID tags to use or may instruct,
     at times, different RFID tags to turn themselves off or not reply for a
     period of time. This strategy may eliminate conflicts between overlapping
     signals from nearby RFID tags.
<BR><BR>[0208] Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail
     for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be apparent that
     certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of
     the appended claims. For instance, while the gaming machines of this
     invention have been depicted as having top box mounted on top of the main
     gaming machine cabinet, the use of gaming devices in accordance with this
     invention is not so limited. For example, gaming machine may be provided
     without a top box.
