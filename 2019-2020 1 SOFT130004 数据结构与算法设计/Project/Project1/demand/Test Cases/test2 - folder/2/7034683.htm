<BR><BR>Non-provisional application of Provisional Application No. 60/246,291, filed on Nov.  6, 2000.
<BR><BR>STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT
<BR><BR>Not Applicable
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>Field of Invention
<BR><BR>The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for tracking the location of vehicles, such as trucks/trailers, buses, aircrafts, trains, containers, cargo, pallets/packages and personnel, and more particularly to an improved
system and method for tracking the location of a plurality of trucks/trailers, buses, pallets/packages or personnel at a particular location or a site to ascertain the exact location at which any vehicle, and it's content is located, as well as to
ascertain when the proper pallet/package or personnel is being dropt off or picked up at exact given address.  Locations at which relatively large number of vehicles, pallets/packages and personnel are present often suffer from the problem of determining
exactly where each vehicle, pallet/package or personnel is.  Whether a particular vehicle, pallet/package or personnel is located at a particular location when the business has several different sites, vehicles, pallets/packages and personnel is also
problematic.  This problem is particularly common to large and small trucking companies, railroad, freight companies, delivery companies, rapid transit public transportation, airlines, school bus service, utility companies, rental car agencies, leasing
companies, distribution warehouse, retail stores, office buildings, and schools.  In addition, such businesses must also deal with the theft of vehicles and the content in the vehicles, goods in warehouse, and the job attendance of employee.  In schools,
child school attendance is often an important task to be dealt with.
<BR><BR>A number of different methods have been used in the past to deal with the problem of tracking the location of a large number of vehicles, its drivers, content delivery, or warehouse pallets/packages along with employee attendance, or school bus
and child school attendance.  The oldest of these methods is by keeping an inventory register of each vehicle and its content and its delivery records in a paper journal of some kind, or more recently, in a hand held computerized database.  Inventory
register depending on each individual operator may move a pallet/package for any reason, recording that move, as well as the vehicle's new location.  Ultimately, this system will not accurately reflect the location of all vehicles, pallets/packages and
personnel simply because not all employees at a location will enter each move of vehicle, pallet/package, personnel or student.
<BR><BR>As might be expected, a variety of different approaches have been taken to attempt to solve the problem of monitoring large numbers of vehicles, pallets/packages and or personnel at a location or in a vehicle.  These approaches vary widely,
encompassing both increase security measures, proper global flow of distribution of goods, fixed and mobile inventory control, track vehicles with its content and personnel.  With regard first to increase security measures of particular application to
vehicle content at a location or at a warehouse site, the measures taken commonly include security fences or compounds, the use of video monitoring of area in which vehicles and cargo are stored, the use of motion sensor alarm in such areas, and the use
of security guards to patrol such areas.  While such approaches may reduce the incident of theft, somewhat, they are not useful in the addressing the primary problem contemplated by the present invention, namely how to keep track of the location of

<BR><BR>The "Electronic Tracking Tag" of U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,144,301 issued to Frieden discloses an electronic tracking tag attached to various assets to assist in asset identification.  A plastic visual label display tag is used with a receiving cavity to
mechanically lock an RFID transponder.  The Tag body with the electronic transponder may be secured to the asset by screw.  Alternatively, one or more flexible strap may extend in the tag body for strapping the tag body to the physical asset.
<BR><BR>The electronic tag disclosed by Frieden does not provide tamper proof pressure sensing tamper switch with protective metal "O" ring, neither utilizes optical conductivity sensing nylon strap for strapping the tag on to a pallet or object.  One
can easily remove said tag and remove the asset undetected.
<BR><BR>The "Radio tag system and method with improved tag interference avoidance" of U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,034,603 issued to Steeves teaches a data transmission system that includes a reader transceiver.  The reader transmits an activation signal to a tag. 
The tag selectively transmits a response signal to reader at a specific time.  The detector operates in a low-power standby state until the time it receives the activation signal.
<BR><BR>The radio tag system disclosed by Steeves has an improved tag interference avoidance system that reads multiple tags within the range of a set radius, and the tag operates all the time at low power standby mode until an activation signal causes
the tag to operate.  Steeves' system fails to locate the presence of an object in an area with many partitions, or for example, where there are many building at a given site, within communication range of a site transceiver and tag units.
<BR><BR>Use of mutter mode in asset tracking for gathering data from cargo sensors in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,686,888 issued to Welles, al et. teaches goods being monitored while in transit using local area network of tracking assets.  Electronic sensors are
situated in proximity to the cargo.  The sensors communicate with asset tracking unit affixed to the container.  The tracking unit has the ability to relay the cargo sensor data to central station.
<BR><BR>The sensors affixed to the container disclosed by Welles do not use tamper proof sensors.  Therefore, one can easily remove and defeat the purpose of usage.  Sensor's transmitting periodically creates collision problem and the sensor used in
Welles system has to be programmed into tracking unit in order to poll sensor data.  Additionally, the Welles system cannot differentiate presence of goods around or within container.  Further, the Welles system does not generate an alarm system if goods
are removed from the vehicle without authorization entry and does not activate stolen tag RF transmitter to transmit an alarm condition signal.  Therefore, one could hardly locate a stolen asset.
<BR><BR>The "Electronic anti-shoplifting system employing RFID tag" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,874,896 issued to Lowe, et al. teaches an electronic ant-shoplifting system that monitors articles of merchandise.  The transponder tags are connected to articles of
merchandise and a tag exciter is positioned at exit.  If customer carries an article through exit without removal authorization, the transponder tag is activated by generating a surveillance response signal that triggers an alarm.
<BR><BR>The tags used in Lowe's teaching does not have RFID transponder with built-in RF transceiver with power on circuitry, to account real time presence of an object affixed with a tag in a shopping area.  The tag used in Lowe system does not use
tamper sensing tags, one can thus remove the merchandise tag and walk away unnoticed, and one can move tagged merchandise out of a store, without being noticed by the tag exciter.
<BR><BR>The "Asset Location System" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,069,570 issued to Herring discloses an asset location system that includes a pager, a control processor, a GPS receiver and a cell phone.  During normal operation, the equipment on the tracked
asset is in a low power or sleep mode.  Upon receiving a location queerer from a call center, a control processor is powered up.  The latitude and longitude information is put in a transmittable form by a cellular phone modem to a monitoring station.
<BR><BR>The Herring system using a pager to receive queerer from a call and a cellular phone modem for transmitting data is not economically practical because one has to consider a minimum monthly service fee to be paid by user for pager and cell
communication.  This makes usage of the Herring system not to appealing to end user.  The Herring system does not use a tamper resistive GPS/Cell modem, such that the GPS unit can be easily removed and its purpose be easily defeated.
<BR><BR>The "Method and Apparatus for Providing a Personal locator, Access control and asset Tracking service using a building telephone network" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,363,425 issued to Muffi, et al. describes a system where users carry an ID badges
containing an RF transmitters can be located across the telephone network for receiving incoming calls.  The receiver units in or near telephone sets instruct the system of the identification of the user located near the telephone set.  In additions tags
are used on assets, which communicate with receiver units near telephone sets in a building for tracking asset movement across the building.  The tag disclosed by Muffi does not provide Metal "O" ring protection around the tamper sensor switch; neither
the optical nylon conductive belt body worn nor asset mount tags.  The Muffi tamper sensing asset tags can easily be removed by sliding a flat object (knife.  Envelop opener) beneath the tag and holding the pressure sensor switch to defeat its purpose,
and the personnel ID tags can also be easily removed.  The usage of building phone line limits the personnel and asset monitoring to building application only.
<BR><BR>The "Personnel Monitoring Tag" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,745,037 issued to Guthrie, et al. discloses a method for accounting for plurality of persons based on random interval monitoring system to report information regarding the presence of both
desired and undesired condition affecting a person.  The method includes a first step of transmitting information signal based upon random times from individual tag worn by person corresponding to whether a tag is being worn and to certain activity of
person, by use of pressure and motion sensor.
<BR><BR>The tag disclosed by Guthrie et al. does not contain combination of RFID and RF transceivers.  The tag's RF transceiver does not automatically activate by entry way magnetic interrogation, neither uses tag receiver push to weak up activation
switch, and the tag mounting strap used in the Guthrie art is not of optical conductive nylon.  The communication technique used in the Guthrie system cannot identify location of a tag in a specific room or a patrician in a building or even in trailers
due to fact RF transceivers used in the Guthrie method could easily overlap each other.  In addition, long-term random transmission from large number of tags in an area will create a communication collision due to fact long term tag transmitter RTC will
change, and additionally when new personnel tag appearance in the system easily causes collision.  The usage of spread spectrum communication in a site with large number of tags has its limitation, for example, the spread spectrum technique consumes
higher energy and its expensive, means requires larger size battery which increases tags size and cost.  Again pressure sensor switch and the strap used in Guthrie teaching could be defeated by sliding a flat object under the tag for holding the tamper
switch, and conductive strap could be jumped by poking with an sharp edged external conductive material and cut the belt and enlarge the overall diameter of the strap and then tag can be easily removed.
<BR><BR>The "Global Security System" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,497,149 issued to Fast describes a system for determining the position of an object to be protected using a local or global positioning system and issuing messages to a monitoring center at
predetermined times and or a times when the object to be protected is under an alert condition, such as being outside an allowed position zone during a defined time period.
<BR><BR>The Fast method does not apply for person or object mount GPS/modem or pager transceiver unit to power up and transmit object location information when an object leaves a designated site such as a building or a vehicle at any given time.
<BR><BR>The "Decentralized tracking and routing system wherein packages are associated with active tags" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,627,517 issued to Theimer, et al. describes that, in freight tracking and touting system, each package is provided with a tag
physically attached thereto.  The tag includes a radio or infrared transceiver.  The transceivers broadcast signals representative of their location.  The microprocessor, in response to receiving a desired destination signal, emits a signal commanding
external equipment to take the package so that it remains at the desired location.  The tags are also capable of electronically queried, or can emit distress signal when they do not reach a particular location at a particular time.
<BR><BR>Theimer system, although is useful in determining a package destination, uses the location transceiver that does not send package information from a distribution center to a vehicle or an aircraft mount GPS based unit in order to track package
location, prompt delivery or pick-up, based on (longitude altitude) exact given address, neither use tamper resistive tag to avoid package theft.
<BR><BR>The "Asset monitoring system and associated method" illustrated in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,917,433 to Keollor et al. describes asset monitoring system providing remotely located central station with information relating to a container, both during
tethered periods in which the energy reservoir of asset monitoring electrically is connected to an external power source, such as a truck, or using untethered mode when trailer energy source is disconnected.  The controller includes power management
means for placing the asset monitoring in an active mode during tethered periods and energy conservation mode during untethered periods.
<BR><BR>Although Keollor energy serving method is useful, so as the trailer door sensors, it does not provide secure asset monitoring.  Keollor's teaching does not provide tamper sensing GPS/modem transceivers unit, which upon tamper detection
immobilizes the vehicle (truck/trailer) and transmit GPS tamper detection signal to a monitoring station.  It additionally does not provide trailer door electronic lock mechanism which enables a remotely operated (key fob) unit for operator to be able to
open trailer door at a given (longitude/latitude) address.  Further, Keollor's teaching does not provide electronic RFID trailer gate readers to electronically log in and out pallets or packages there shall for trailer content cannot be monitored.
<BR><BR>The "Security for Transport Vehicles and Cargo" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,969,595 to Schipper et al. teaches a method and apparatus for providing security vehicles and for cargo transported on a vehicle.  A cargo unit carries a transceiver or
transmitter that transmits a selected signal which is examined as to signal intensity, signal coding and or time of receipt.  If the receiving signal violates a selected condition, vehicle location is compared with an approved cargo location.  If the
vehicle is not near the cargo destination, or if no selected signal received at the receiver, an alarm signal is transmitted, to a monitoring station which may include the vehicle location, and to a selected cargo transceiver unit to activate a become
signal.  The method further comprises the steps of locking said cargo unit when said vehicle leaves a selected location or to unlock the cargo carrying volume only at least one of the following locations is within selected distance from one approved
cargo destination.
<BR><BR>Schipper et al. is perhaps the most detailed of such apparatus for providing secure cargo transport on a vehicle illustrates both the benefit and the limitation of such system.  While the Schipper et al. system is highly useful and represents a
significant improvement in the art, it does not address the problem addressed by the present invention namely no tamper sensing GPS/modem unit being used which upon tamper detection immobilizes the vehicle and report to central station.  No vehicle
(trailer, railcar) electronic gate lock being used which opens only by operator key-fob, at given vehicle address location (longitude latitude).  No vehicle gate tag RFID reader is provided to ascertain cargo being within the vehicle, and no use of RFID
Reader, which automatically powers up the tags upon entry to communicate with vehicle transceiver unit for real time presence authentication.  The cargo tags are not equipped with pressure sensing protective "O" ring tamper switch, neither uses tags with
tamper sensing optical nylon conductive strap for mounting the tags on cargo.  The Schipper system cannot secure the vehicle and its cargo content, thus one easily can remove the vehicle mount GPS/modem unit and drive away with the vehicle and steal the
cargo content without being tracked.  The cargo tags can be removed and dropped near or within the vehicle, and cargo can be taken away without being tracked.  Unlocking of cargo container by distance at an approve destination used in Schipper teaching,
cannot secure the cargo at an approved destination.  One will assume in an approved destination center, upon cargo arrival the cargo lock opens near warehouse distribution center.  Any one at distribution center can open the cargo door detach the tags
and remove the cargo without being noticed or detected.
<BR><BR>The "Programmable Vehicle Monitoring and Security System having access verification Devices" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 5,986,543 to Johnson teaches a security system having two ways communication with a central monitoring station.  Control communication
connected to intrusion detection devises.  The control unit in response to detection of an intrusion establishes a communication leak with monitoring station.  The control and communication devise is operable to receive commands from a handset
electrically connection.
<BR><BR>Johnson disclosure of a detecting intrusion is a useful art, however Johnson does not use tamper detection GPS/modem unit, neither tamper sensing cellular or GPS antenna.  One can disconnect or break the GPS or cell antenna found in Johnson
system or access the vehicle disconnect the GPS modem and drive away with the vehicle.
<BR><BR>"Method for retrieving vehicular collateral" in U.S.  Pat.  No. 6,025,774 to Forbes describes a method of securing vehicle for a loan.  The method provides for installing a transmitter within the vehicle, the transmitter is capable of
transmitting location data regarding the vehicle.  A data link is established from a base terminal to the transmitter of the vehicle.  The loan status is being monitored for default from a monitoring station.  Upon occurrence of the default, the location
of the vehicle is determined, and the vehicle is confiscated.
<BR><BR>Forbes method is very useful but not dependable for securing vehicle loan.  If one forfeits the loan and had no intention to return the vehicle, could easily defeat the GPS antenna or the entire GPS/Cellular modem and drive away with the vehicle. Even ship the vehicle out of the country without being tracked.
<BR><BR>It is accordingly the primary objective of the present invention that it provides an secure electronic vehicle, cargo, and personnel tracking information system which will track the present location of each of plurality of vehicles, pallets, and
personnel at a location such as, for example, on the road, railways, trailers, trucks, aircraft, buses, in warehouses, retail stores, offices, homes, schools, .  . . , etc.
<BR><BR>It is a related objective of the present invention that the monitoring of vehicles, cargo, and personnel location at the location be performed completely automatically via GPS/modem, pager or satellite and RF wireless data communication, with use
of computer network, intranet or internet.  It is a further objective of the electronic vehicle, cargo, personnel tracking information system of present invention that it be capable of automatically determining when each vehicle arrive and departs from a
site and be able determine which cargo, or personnel (passenger, student) securely got pick up or delivered by a vehicle at a given site address.  It is a further objective of the invention that is capable to determine when each cargo or personnel
entered or exit a site and provides real time secure presence inventory or attendance count, at mobile or fixed sites.  It is further objective of present invention to provide security by immobilizing vehicle upon equipment tamper, use site and vehicle
gate RFID readers, provide electronic vehicle (Truck/Trailer) gate lock unlock operated by driver remote key fob responsive only at given address, and tamper resistive communication devises on vehicles, cargo, and personnel.  It is further the objective
of the invention to determine vehicle driver and loader authentication and access recording; and to track and locate stolen vehicle and cargo or lost or kidnapped personnel.
<BR><BR>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>An electronic vehicle, cargo and personnel monitoring system is provided, allowing a vehicle to electronically login its product content (pallets, products) ID, its driver or passenger(s) ID into an on board vehicle CPU.  The CPU will communicate
via an RF signal containing information of the vehicle, cargo (product) and driver/passenger, with a base station(s) computer or computer network which indicates the presence or absence of a vehicle at a site, its cargo content and its driver/passenger
ID at a predetermine site.
<BR><BR>A Base or site station computer is connected to a RF transceiver unit to communicate with a vehicle-mount RF Transceiver CPU, and cargo tags or driver/passenger tags.
<BR><BR>A vehicle-mount tamper proof RF transceiver CPU with an RFID tag reader is installed within the vehicle doorway, in which when tagged object goes through vehicle door, the tag read unit will read the tag and send said tag information to vehicle
RF transceiver unit, and vehicle transceiver unit communicates with the base or site station computer unit, with information relating to vehicle content, such as vehicle cargo and driver/passenger equipped with a RFID tags.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment an RFID transponder with RF tamper proof transceiver tag units are installed in or outside of cargo with adhesive tape, mounting screws or an optical nylon (string) conductive strap, to communicate in time interval with
vehicle mount transceiver CPU unit and base station computer transceiver unit.
<BR><BR>A RFID Tamper proof transceiver tag unit with an optical nylon conductive strap is mounted on a person wrist or ankle to communicate with the vehicle-mount transceiver CPU unit and the base station computer interface transceiver unit.
<BR><BR>A product or a person carrying an RFID tag its data information is logged in manually or by a tag read unit and downloaded into a base station PC.  This indicates the presence of a particular product or person(s) (part of inventory) at a site,
for example, a factory, retail store, school site.  The site gate(s) is equipped with RFID tag read unit connected to the site computer interface transceiver unit.  When a product or a person carrying RFID tag passes through said gate, the gate read unit
reads the ID tag and said site computer indicates the departure or entry of the particular product or person departure from said site.  If the product or person passes through said gate without computer-authorized access code, the computer would generate
an alarm signal to the operator and autodials to a central monitoring station or to a pager system indicating a security violation.
<BR><BR>A vehicle (truck, trailer, aircraft, railroad car, bus etc.) is equipped with a RF transceiver CPU when said vehicle arrives at a particular site, RF signals containing information of a particular vehicle are periodically sent to said site PC by
means of a switch, such as a push button switch, ignition switch, a door switch or an emergency brake switch.  When the site computer interface unit receiver receives the signal from the particular vehicle, the site station computer unit indicates the
presence of the presence of the particular vehicle at that particular site.  Or upon receipt of signal, the computer creates a communication slot (transmitting air time) in its database memory to communicate at time intervals (once a minute) with said
particular vehicle transceiver CPU unit with an RF signal containing data information of the particular vehicle RF transceiver CPU, to verify particular vehicle presence at a particular site.  Additionally the vehicle is equipped with an RFID tag read
unit(s) mounted at vehicle doorway(s) or gate(s) and connected to vehicle mount RF transceiver CPU.  When a product or a person carrying RFID tag unit(s) enters the particular vehicle, the vehicle RFID Tag read unit reads the tag ID of the particular
product(s) or person(s) and logs the information data in to the vehicle CPU, and the CPU transmits the particular vehicle, product or person(s) tag ID to said site computer interface unit, and said site computer interface sends signals to said vehicle
CPU with a RF coded signal indicating to driver acknowledgment of right product or driver/passenger entered the particular vehicle and stores said information in a central server.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment of the invention the vehicle CPU upon receiving signals from site computer transceiver, transmits the vehicle CPU ID, product and or person(s) ID information data to the site computer interface unit, which indicates a
particular vehicle ID, containing particular product(s) and particular person(s) at a particular site at a set time and date.  The base station computer interface unit gives live update to the operator(s) periodically by communicating, for example, once
a minute, with the vehicle transceiver CPU unit to confirm the presence of a particular vehicle and its content at a particular location.
<BR><BR>If a product or a passenger boarded in a wrong vehicle, the computer initiates a an alarm signal, and sends a signal to the vehicle CPU, which generates a audible alarm signal indicating to the driver, boarding of a wrong product or passenger
into that particular vehicle.  When the vehicle departs and is out of communication range, the base station computer indicates the absence of the particular vehicle at that particular site.  If unauthorized (without computer access code) departure of
vehicle takes place from said site and said vehicle transceiver CPU becomes out of communication range or said communication becomes interrupted 2 interval times with the site computer transceiver unit, the site computer initiates a security violation
signal and sends said data information to monitoring station.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vehicle uses a tamper sensing RF transceiver CPU, a GPS cellular modem or 2-way pager with a tamper sensing antenna.  The units are equipped with pressure sensing tamper switch on its case; and the
case for mounting the tamper switch mount is installed on the vehicle body or window.  The vehicle transceiver CPU or GPS/modem and the antenna unit is communicating with digital data with said vehicle fuel pump or starter relay circuitry, so as to
operation the vehicles fuel pump or starter.  When an unauthorized attempt is being made to remove or disconnect the vehicle RF transceiver, the GPS/modem or antenna, the RF transceiver or GPS/modem processor sees sending (or sending intermittent)
digital data to the vehicle fuel pump or starter relay, thus slowing down the vehicle speed and immobilizing the vehicle or immobilizing the vehicle starter circuitry, and transmitting a RF or cellular or pager "tamper" signal to a monitoring station. 
The tamper signal contains information to the particular vehicle unit with a "tamper" detection signal along with location information.  Same process takes place when the vehicle RF transceiver CPU and GPS/modem or antenna cable is being interrupted by
an unauthorized person or when units gets abused or damaged, becomes inoperative.
<BR><BR>When the vehicle arrives a predetermined destination to unload its product(s), the vehicle CPU communicates with an RF signal with the particular site computer transceiver unit, the site computer, upon receiving said signal, logs the particular
vehicle ID presence into that site computer and sends a unique RF coded signal to the vehicle CPU which will generate a signal to vehicle door locks mechanism to open, by use of drivers key fob, and permit driver to unload particular product at that
particular site.  Each one of said products carrying RFID tag departing from said vehicle is scanned by said vehicle gate tag RFID read unit and said information is logged into vehicle CPU unit.  The logged data is transmitted into a site computer
interface by means of RF communication, which indicates a particular product drop off at that particular site.  If unscheduled product drop off at the wrong site takes place the site computer will create an alarm warring signal and send a RF signal to
the vehicle CPU that will notify the driver by means of an alarm signal.
<BR><BR>When a bus arrives a predetermined destination to unload its passenger(s), the person carrying RFID tag departs (exit) from the vehicle is scanned by the vehicle door tag RFID read unit and said information is logged in vehicle CPU.  The logged
data is transmitted into said site computer by means of RF communication and the site computer, upon receipt of said vehicle signal, the computer unit confirms the vehicle CPU that the right person(s) have been dropped at the right site.
<BR><BR>When the vehicle arrives a predetermined destination to load product(s) or person(s) storefront, house, the vehicle CPU communicates with the particular site computer transceiver unit.  The site computer, upon receiving said signal, logs in the
particular vehicle ID presence into that site computer which indicates by an audio visual signal for the presence of a particular vehicle at a particular site.  When a product(s) or person carrying RFID tag unit enters the vehicle, the vehicle tag reader
unit, upon reading each of said tag unit, connecting to the vehicle transceiver CPU, the CPU transmits a RF signal containing information of said vehicle ID and said product or person tag ID, into the site computer transceiver unit.  When the site
computer transceiver unit receives the signal, transmits the vehicle's ID and the product or person ID information to a central station computer and sends a RF Data signal to the vehicle transceiver CPU, which upon receipt of signal, produces
confirmation signal to the driver indicating the boarding of a right product or person at a site.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment of the invention each one of said tamper proof RFID transponder tags additionally is equipped with a RF transceiver unit powered by a battery.  When a product (pallet) or person carrying said RFID/RF transceiver tag
enters a site (building) equipped with RFID tag read unit at its gate(s) or door(s), the tag reader reads the entered tags and sends the information to the site computer.  Upon reading the tags RFID information, the computer creates a particular slot
(communication air time) in its data base memory to communicate at time intervals (once a minute, for example) with said tag transceiver by a RF signal, so as to indicate presence of a particular tag unit at that particular site, at a set time.  The
product RFID RF transceiver is equipped with a pressure sensing tamper switch and is installed in or outside of a product, the tamper sensing switch side being faced to the product, and mounted on by use of double sided adhesive tape, or magnet or
mounted by screw(s).  Additionally a conductive strap could be utilized over, under and across a product (pallet) connected to the RFID RF transceiver tags to avoid product (pallet) temperament.  Further, an RFID RF transceiver unit is mounted with a
conductive strap on a person wrist or ankle to be monitored.  If unauthorized removal of any tag occurs, the tag tamper switch senses removal of tag from the product or person.  If the conductive strap is being cut, in both cases the tag RF transceiver
unit transmits a tamper signal.  The site computer transceiver and vehicle CPU unit, upon receiving said signal, issue a tamper alarm signal to monitoring station to alert security personal.  If a product or a person exits the site through a gate with
computer controlled clearance code, when the RFID RF transceiver unit goes out of site communication range within a predetermine time, the RFID RF transceiver stops transmitting time interval signal to save energy.  If unauthorized attempt is been made
(without computer clearance) to remove the product (pallet) or the person walks away from the site gate, the site gate tag read unit upon reading the product or person RFID-RF transceiver signals, the site computer indicates a security violation, and the
computer transceiver unit initiates a security violation RF coded signal to the particular product RFID-RF transceiver tag unit, which upon receipt of said security violation signal, starts transmitting a RF signal containing information to the
particular product with security violation code.  In another embodiment of invention, if a product or person becomes (without computer clearance) out of computer communication range or communication between the site computer and a particular RFID
transceiver tag becomes interrupted (after 2 communication attempts), the site computer will initiate an alarm signal, and send a signals to a central station via public phone or paging network for quick recovery a hand held, patrol car or chopper mount
RF scanner unit used to locate stolen product.
<BR><BR>Since a vehicle CPU unit requires a product unloading clearance signal from a site computer transceiver, if and when a vehicle gets car jack or driver decides to unload some or all of its product(s) or pallets in an unauthorized location site
without receiving clearance signal, the vehicle CPU sends a RF signal to the particular product RFID-RF transceiver tag when the product passes through the vehicle gate tag read unit.  Upon receiving the signal, the tag RFID RF transceiver unit transmits
an RF signal containing information to said particular RFID-RF tag along with security violation code.  In a preferred embodiment of the invention the vehicle (truck/trailer) gates open (for loading or unloading product) with the use of electronic gate
locks (Solenoid Dead bolt) the gate lock will lock or unlock only after receiving a gate open or close RF signal from a particular base station or site computer transceiver unit.  If an unauthorized attempt is made to open the gate without base station
signal, the vehicle CPU transceiver unit will transmit an RF signal containing information of that particular vehicle with a security violation code to a base station or monitoring station computer.
<BR><BR>It is an objective of the present invention to utilize a GPS/modem or pager unit to communicate with a monitoring station or a site station, so as to monitor vehicle location, its driver authentication and personnel (passengers, students)
information, by connecting said vehicle GPS unit to a vehicle gate or door entryway installed RFID tag reader, which logs in and out tagged cargo or personnel within said vehicle.  It is another objective of the present invention to provide proper flow
of product and personnel distribution, by comparing product and personnel tag data read by vehicle GPS RFID reader unit, with the destination data stored in vehicle GPS unit.  If the product or personnel is scanned by the vehicle RFID reader as they
exiting the vehicle, and if the personnel or product RFID tag scanned information such as the actual physical location of vehicle by longitude/latitude does not match the given product or personnel address stored within the GPS unit database, the vehicle
GPS unit will send an alarm signal to the driver.  If the driver does not return the wrong tagged product or personnel back into truck/trailer or bus within a predetermined time, the GPS modem unit will transmit an security violation to a monitoring
station.
<BR><BR>It is another objective of the present invention that provides an electronic dead bolt lock to lock said truck/trailer or bus door(s), which will activate by receiving a signal from a driver key fob unit only when vehicle mount GPS unit arrives a
given address that matches the address information entered in the GPS data logger (longitude/latitude).  In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vehicle uses a tamper sensing RF transceiver CPU and a GPS cellular modem or 2-way pager with tamper
sensing antenna.  The units are equipped with pressure sensing tamper switch on its case.  The side of the case for mounting the tamper switch is installed against the vehicle body or window.  The vehicle transceiver CPU or GPS/modem and the antenna unit
is communicating with digital data with said vehicle fuel pump or starter relay circuitry, so as to operate the vehicles fuel pump or starter.  When an unauthorized attempt is being made to remove or disconnect the vehicle RF transceiver, GPS/modem or
antenna, the tamper switch triggers the CPU or GPS/modem.  The RF transceiver or GPS/modem processor sees sending (or sending intermittent) digital data to the vehicle fuel pump or starter relay, thus slowing down the vehicle speed and immobilizing the
vehicle or immobilizing the vehicle starter circuitry, and transmit a RF or cellular or pager "tamper" signal to a monitoring station, containing information about a particular vehicle unit with a "tamper" detection signal along with location
information.  Same process takes place when the vehicle RF transceiver CPU and GPS/modem or antenna cable is being cut or disconnected by an unauthorized person or when units gets abused or damaged, becomes inoperative.
<BR><BR>In the present invention in order to monitor the product and person with an unlimited distance monitoring capability for long period of time, each one of said RFID-RF transceiver tag unit additionally contains a GPS/cell modem, pager, or a
satellite communication unit, which is installed on the product (pallet) or person.  The GPS/cellular modem or pager or satellite unit is in power-off mode in order not to use energy.  When any of said product or person carrying departs without computer
clearance from said site or vehicle equipped with RFID gate read unit and RF transceiver unit, when the tag passes through the gate reader by generating a magnetic field, which will power up the RF transceiver, and the RF transceiver upon receiving
security violation code will power on the GPS/modem unit.  Both the GPS and RF transceiver will transmit an emergency stolen good signal.  In addition, if the transceiver tag read unit goes out of communication range of said site computer or vehicle RF
transceiver, the site computer or vehicle transceiver will initiate a security violation signal to said RFID RF transceiver tag, which, upon receipt of said signal powers up said tag GPS/cellular modem or pager, which will then transmit GPS based
product(s) or person(s) location information along with said RFID tag information to a monitoring station.
<BR><BR>Additionally all said RF communication between said vehicles and said base station can use a mobile phone, 2-way pager, UHF/VHF, or satellite communication means.
<BR><BR>If the location of a particular product(s) or person(s) on a site (warehouse, factory, school) is desired, a plurality of transponder read units is installed at an assigned spots at a predetermine location at a site.  When any one of said
products or person carrying said RFID tag unit comes close into communicating range (within 2 meters), said transponder read unit communicates with said RFID tag unit and transmits said RFID tag information to said site PC and said PC logs the data
information and displays location of said product or person on its monitor.  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a plurality of short range (1 5 meter) low power RF proximity transmitters unit powered by a battery is installed at a
assigned spot(s) at a predetermined location at a site, transmitting periodically (every 12 Seconds.) with a unique identification code.  When a product or person carrying the RFID transceiver unit receives a RF signal from said site computer transceiver
unit, said RFID transceiver unit being within communication range of said proximity transmitter unit (within predetermined time of 12 sec.) will read said proximity transmitter unit ID code data and transmit a RF signal containing information for both
said proximity unit and said product or person RFID transceiver unit, and when said site computer transceiver unit receives said signal will indicate said product or said persons presence along with its location at a site.
<BR><BR>Additionally each one of said RFID-RF transceiver units could have a built in push button allowing the user to read a particular spot proximity transmitter ID data by pressing said button.  Upon reading said proximity transmitter ID, the RFID
transceiver transmits a signal containing both proximity transmitter and RFID-RF transceiver data information to a site transceiver PC, which will indicate the presence of a product or person with its location at a site. <BR><BR>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>An embodiment of an electronic vehicle and cargo tracking information system of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 1A.  As shown, a site station warehouse 20 is equipped with a RFID gate read antenna 29, a RFID gate reader 22 and a site
station RFID read CPU, which is connected to a site station computer 26.  A RFID tag 19 with a unique code is mounted on a pallet 21, and said unique code is programmed in to the site station computer 26.  When an operator of the site station computer 26
registers an invoice or bill of lading, the content of the pallet 21 and an RFID tag ID number of the pallet 21 are input into the site station computer 26.  In addition, the vehicle 30 for transporting the pallet 21 includes a RF transceiver 36 which
will present an ID number and destination address of the pallet 21.  When the pallet 21 departs through the gate 23 of the site station 20, the gate RFID reader antenna 29 will energize the RFID tag 19 of the pallet by means of magnetic field.  The ID
code data of the tag 19 mounted on the pallet 21 is thus transmitted to the RFID gate read antenna 29.  The gate RFID antenna 29 then transmits said data through said station RFID reader 22 into the site station computer 26.  Thereby, the departure of
said particular pallet 21 from its inventory system is indicated.
<BR><BR>The vehicle 30 is equipped with a RFID gate read antenna 40, a RFID read CPU 32 which is connected to a vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36 and a driver RFID read antenna 37 connected to said vehicle RFID read CPU 32.  A driver 27 may wear a RFID wrist
mount transponder or a tag 24 with a unique ID code to enter the vehicle 30.  Upon turning the ignition key on, said vehicle RFID tag read CPU 32 will read said driver RFID tag 24, and sends the driver ID information data to the vehicle RF transceiver
CPU 36, which stores the driver authentication information in the RF transceiver CPU data base.  The vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36 starts sending digital data through vehicle harness.  Said data is being picked up by a vehicle immobilizer CPU 128 as
shown in FIG. 3H.  Upon receipt of the data, the vehicle immobilizer CPU 128 will energize a vehicle starter or fuel pump relay 129, allowing the driver 27 to operate the vehicle 30.  In a preferred embodiment in order to operate the vehicle fuel pump,
it necessary for the vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36 to provide constant data flow through vehicle wires to said immobilizer CPU 128, otherwise the vehicle immobilizer CPU 128 will shut down the vehicle fuel pump relay 129.
<BR><BR>When the vehicle 30 arrives near said site station 20, by pressing vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36, or by turning the vehicle 30 in parking position (which will activate transmission switch), the vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36 will transmit an RF
signal containing information of said vehicle 30.  Said site station RF transceiver 28 receives said signal through the site station RF antenna 25, and uploads said vehicle ID and driver ID information in the computer data base 26, and indicates the
presence of said particular vehicle 30 at that particular site 20.  A RF signal is transmitted through site station RF transceiver 28 into said vehicle RF transceiver 36, so that the driver 27 can use of a remote key-fob to transmit a signal into the
vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36, so as to unlock vehicle gate lock solenoid 34.  The site station computer operator, based on the driver and vehicle information, can prepare the particular vehicle and particular cargo bill of lading (invoice).
<BR><BR>When the vehicle gate 41 is opened, the vehicle gate switch 33 sends a signal to the vehicle RFID read CPU 32, which energizes the vehicle gate read antenna 40 by a magnetic field.  When a particular pallet 21 with RFID tag 19 is loaded in the
truck 30, the vehicle RFID gate reader antenna 40 upon interrogating the pallet tag and loader (driver) tag 24, sends the pallet tag ID data and the driver tag ID data to the vehicle RFID read CPU 32.  The data is processed and sent from the vehicle RFID
read CPU 32 to the vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36, which further transmits said vehicle ID, driver ID and pallet ID information into said site station computer 26.  Thereby, the specific vehicle 30, driver (Loader) 27 and pallet 21 which is located within
the particular vehicle 30 can be indicated, and the given bill of lading instruction into the site computer 26 matching the vehicle ID, driver ID and pallet ID can be retrieved.
<BR><BR>When the vehicle 30 arrives at a given cargo destination site (picture not shown), after logging the vehicle 30 presence at the site computer, a gate open signal from a site computer interfaced RF transceiver is received.  When the driver 27
moves the pallets 21 out of vehicle 30, the vehicle RFID read CPU 32 reads the driver and pallet ID and sends the data via the vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36 into said site computer 26.  Since the system runs on intranet or internet data base, the
destination site computer will accept the delivered pallets 26 to be logged in database as part of incoming inventory.  If a pallet 21 was not destined to said particular site station, the site computer will generate an alarm signal, indicating wrong
package arrival at the site.  The site computer also sends an RF signal to the vehicle RF transceiver unit 36 for notifying the driver to reload the pallet 21 back into truck inventory.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one tamper sensing RFID tag is provided with a unique code and connected to a built-in RF low power transceiver with the same unique code.  The tamper sensing RFID tags are powered by a
battery.  As shown in FIG. 3D, an RFID/RF transceiver tag 80 mounted to a product 81 is equipped with a reset switch 84 and a pressure sensing tamper switch 82.  FIG. 3G shows a top view of a tamper sensing RFID tag 90 that includes a pressure sensing
tamper switch 91 protected by a metal "O" ring 94.  The tags 80, 90, are mounted on pallets 100 or product 81 with the use of screws 92, adhesive tape 83, 93.  The adhesive tape 93 may also be replaced by magnet 93, for example.
<BR><BR>In another teaching of the new art, the tag is mounted on a pallet 110 as shown in FIG. 3E.  In this embodiment, a tamper sensing conductive strap 111 is used to tie a product 113 with the pallet 110, and a conductive strap RFID RF transceiver
112 is attached to the strap 111.  FIG. 3F shows a bottom view of the pallet 110.  As shown, a tamperproof pallet mount RFID/RF transceiver 101 is mounted to a bottom surface 100 of the pallet 110.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment, the driver RFID tag 24 may be in the form of a tamper-sensing wrist-mount watch-style RFID tag 50 as shown in FIG. 3A.  The tag 50 has a unique code installed in a RF transceiver 53.  As shown, the tamper-sensing wrist-mount
watch-style RFID tag 50 is also equipped with a reset push button switch 58 attached to an optical nylon conductive strap 56, a pair of strap connectors 57 attached to two opposing ends of the strap 56, a pair of infrared emitter and collector 51, and a
pair of infrared strings 54 extending through the straps 56.  When a pallet 100, 110 or a personnel carrying a tag 101, 112, 24, or 50 goes through a site station gate 23, the gate RFID read antenna 29 generates a magnetic field, which charges the
built-in capacitors of the RFID tags 101, 112, 24, and 50.  When the capacitor discharges, the RFID tag 101, 112, 24, and 50 transmit the uplink data thereof, and simultaneously power on the tags built-in RF transceiver circuitry for a predetermine time,
for example, 30 sec. When the site station 20 computer receives said pallet or personnel transponder RFID data, it creates a time slot in the database of the computer 26 for said particular tag units 101, 112, 24, 50 and starts communicating with an RF
signal with said tag units transceiver at time interval, through said site station RF transceiver 28, indicating the real time presence of said pallets 101,112 and personnel 27 at the particular site station location.  In some application that site
station 20 my not be equipped with RFID gate readers 22, the RFID-RF transceiver entering a building cannot be powered on by the gate RFID reader 22.  In order to power up the tags RF transceiver 80, 50, the art provides additional, tag-reset switch 84,
58 which is designed to manually power up the tag's RF transceiver by pressing the reset button 84, 58 for a predetermined period of time such as 5 second.
<BR><BR>If the built-in battery of the RFID-RF transceiver tag 101 of the pallet 100 or the personnel wrist transceiver 50 located inside the site station 20 goes low, said tag 101, 50 transmits at given time interval with an additional low battery code,
to said site RF transceiver unit 28, which, upon receipt of said code, sends the received data into said side station computer 26, which will notify the computer operator with a tag maintenance requirement notification.
<BR><BR>If the tamper sensing RFID-RF transceiver tag 90 is removed from said pallet 100, the pressure sensing tamper switch 91 sends signals to the tag RF transceiver, and the transceiver will initiate a tamper signal to said site RF transceiver 28,
which, upon receipt of the signal, will send the tamper code data to said site computer interface 26 to notify operator of particular pallet tag tamper occurrence.  The art teaches the same when unauthorized removal of tags 112, 50 is performed by
detaching the strap connectors 57 or cutting the tag strap 56, 111 without prior tag removal authorization.
<BR><BR>If a pallet 100 with a RFID-RF transceiver tag 101, or a personnel carrying RFID-RF transceiver tag 24, is removed or walked away from said site 20 (not through the site gate) without removal authorization code entry into said site station
computer 26, when the pallet 21 goes out of site station RF transceiver 28 communication range, the site station computer will generate a security violation signal containing information to said particular pallet 21.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said RFID-RF transceiver tag 90 mounted on a pallet 101 is additionally equipped with a HI power 27 Mhz RF transmitter connected to said tag RF transceiver 90.  When an unauthorized cargo departs from
site 20, either through the site station gate 23 or gets removed out of the site station RF transceiver 28 communicating range, the site station RF transceiver 28 will issue an unique RF signal to said pallet tag 101, which, upon receipt, will activate
the built-in HI Power transmitter to transmit at time interval signal containing information relating to said pallet tag ID 101 with stolen code.  This helps security personnel to locate within 2 miles radius the stolen cargo by use of hand held monitor
(picture not Shown).
<BR><BR>If and when a cargo carrying an RFID-RF tag 101 or personnel tag 24 set by site computer 26 operator departs from the site station, upon exit of the tag 101 and 24 from the site station gate 23, the gate RFID reader 29, 22 reads the RFID tag data
and send the data to the site station computer 26, and the computer 26 sends an RF signal to said departing tag RF transceiver 101, 24 to shut down it's RF transceiver power.  If the site station 20 is not equipped with the gate RFID reader 22, when a
cargo gets removed or personnel 27 becomes out of said site station 20 and the tag(s) 101, 24 goes beyond RF communicating range; RF transceiver of the tag(s) 101, 24 will power down automatically if the tag(s) 101, 24 does not communicate at time
interval (more then 10 minutes) with the site station computer 26.
<BR><BR>Additionally the site warehouse 10 is equipped with partitions with doorways or partitions sections equipped with RFID tag readers 12, 13, 14 herein described as zone "A" "B" "C" as shown in FIG. 1B.  When a pallet 17 or personnel 24 enters the
partitioned warehouse site, the tag RFID reader 19 reads the pallet 17 or personnel tag ID 24 and sends the information into said site warehouse computer 11, indicating a particular tag or personnel entrance in said warehouse 10 partitions 12.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment, when the pallet 16 or personnel RFID tag 24 having RF transceiver is read by the warehouse computer 11 upon entering the warehouse partition 13, the computer 11 identifies the tag zone, which is zone "B" in this
embodiment and communicates through said site RF transceiver 15 with said pallet 16 or personnel RF transceiver tag on a real time bases indicating the presence of the particular pallet 16 or personnel 24 in a partition at a site.
<BR><BR>A unique GPS based tag 60 equipped with modem/pager and an RF transceiver is provided as shown in FIG. 3B.  The tag 60 is equipped with a phone or pager antenna 66 and a GPS antenna 67, and a tamper sensing strap 61 used for mounting the tag 60
by wrapping the strap around a pallet or a personnel.  The strap includes a conductive rubber strap and an optical nylon string 62 connected to said tag 60 by use of mounting pin post 63.  The tag 60 has conductive and/or optical emitter collector points
64, 65.  The emitter and the collector 64, 65 communicate with an infrared signal through said strap or a conductivity point to complete the conductive circuit.  Loss of conductivity signal and or IR signal causes the tag 60 to transmit a tamper signal. 
In another embodiment the pallet 18 is equipped with a GPS/cellular.
<BR><BR>A modem or a 2-way pager tag is attached to a pallet 18 present a site warehouse partition 14.  When the pallet 18 is moved out of said warehouse site 10 without warehouse computer 11 authorized access entry, and the tag of the pallet 18 goes
through the gate reader 22, 29, the RFID tag powers on the built-in RF transceiver, the reader 22, 29 upon reading the tag ID, sends the information into said site warehouse computer 11 which initiates a signal to the RF transceiver of the tag of the
pallet 18 to activate said pallet's HI power transmitter and GPS/cellular modem.  To help locate the cargo with both GPS and RF signals, a site computer 11 or a hand held RF monitor (picture not shown) can be used.  Wherever GPS signal is not available,
such as under building, parking structures, the security personnel relies on locating the stolen cargo by hand held RF monitor.
<BR><BR>In another embodiment of invention, if the warehouse site 10 is not equipped with a gate RFID reader unit 22, 29.  When a pallet within the warehouse is to be removed from set site 10, a computer 11 generates an RF command to said particular
departing tag, which, upon receipt of signal, will power down the RF transceiver circuitry of the pallet 18, and the pallet can be moved safely out of the site.
<BR><BR>If the pallet 18 is moved out of the warehouse site 10 without going through gate reader 22, 29, and the pallet 18 carrying RFID-RF transceiver with built-in GPS modem becomes out of the communication range of the site warehouse RF transceiver
15, the RF transceiver of the pallet 18 will power up the built-in HI power RF transmitter and the GPS/modem, which transmits a HI power RF signal and a GPS location signal to helps security personnel to locate the cargo containing the pallet 18 both
with GPS and RF monitoring devises.
<BR><BR>The art can be used for monitoring personnel 27 by use of a RF transceiver and a GPS. A personnel 27 carrying a tamper proof GPS/modem, 2 way pager or satellite unit 24a with a built-in RF receiver, in which only the pager receiver is operative
at a very low power stand by mode, and a temper detection wrist RFID-RF transceiver 24 communicating with a site RF transceiver unit 28 at time interval, indicating real time presence of a personnel 27 at a site.  When the personnel 27 departs from said
site, the side RF transceiver 28 no longer receives RF signal from the personnel's wrist transmitter 24, the site computer 26 initiates an RF signal through said site RF transceiver 28 into said personnel GPS/pager receiver 24a to power up the GPS unit
and it's onboard receiver unit, which upon power up, start receiving RF signals at time interval from said personnel wrist transmitter 24, and logs said received data in it's memory.
<BR><BR>Simultaneously the personnel GPS unit 24a receiver receives satellite location data.  The built-in pager unit upon receiving interrogations or at preset time or real time transmits signals containing information to said particular personnel 27
location information.  When the personnel 27 returns back to the site 20, personnel wrist tag 24 establishes communication with the site computer 26, which upon receipt of said signal will transmit a signal to power down said GPS/pager unit 24a along
with built-in RF receiver.
<BR><BR>The embodiment of the invention relates the same to when pallet 100, 110, or personnel 24 enter the vehicle 30, the vehicle gate 41 is open, and the vehicle RFID tag reader 32 energizes the antenna 40.  When the pallets 100 or personal 27 go
through said vehicle gate reader 32, 40, the pallet RFID transponder powers on the tags RF transceiver, and the vehicle RFID tag reader 32, 40 reads tag ID and sends the read ID data to vehicles RF transceiver CPU 36, which upon receipt will create a
communication slot in its data base, and sends short range RF signals to establish communication with the tags 100, 110, by logging on a real time bases the presence of certain pallets or personnel within the vehicle.
<BR><BR>If and when a product carrying an RFID-RF transceiver tag 21 is being unloaded from a truck 30 at a site 20.  The vehicle gate reader 40, 32 reads the tag ID, and sends the read tag data to vehicle RF transceiver unit 36, which upon receipt will
transmits an RF signal containing information to said tag data, into said site station transceiver 28, which upon receipt of said signal, will download the information into site computer 26 data base, indicate a particular cargo 21 drop off near the site
20, and send a confirmation RF signal back to said vehicle RF transceiver CPU 36, which upon receipt of signal, transmits a RF signal to said unloaded tag 21 to power down the tags RF transceiver.  If the wrong pallet 21 being unloaded by driver 27 at a
site 20, the site computer 26 upon receipt of said tag ID information from said vehicle transceiver CPU 36, the site station computer 26 initiates a signal, into said vehicle transceiver unit 36 to ring an alarm signal to the driver 27, warning the
driver removal of wrong cargo from vehicle 30 at the site.  If the driver 27 does not comply, the vehicle RF transceiver 36 will not initiate a power down RF signal to the wrong cargo tag 21, the tag being equipped with an HI power transmitter, at
predetermined time, the tag 21 start automatically transmitting at time interval a stolen cargo alarm signal, which helps authorities or security personnel to locate the stolen cargo by use of hand held RF monitor unit.
<BR><BR>In a preferred embodiment the pallet tag 18 additionally is equipped with GPS/cellular modem or 2 way pager, during an unauthorized removal of pallet from said vehicle 30, said pallet tag unit 19 upon passing the vehicle gate reader 32, 40 will
power on the tags GPS/Cellular modem, pager.  The built-in GPS/modem receiver logs the satellite positioning signals in its data base and transmits said pallet tag ID information along with GPS location information.  This will expedite to locate the
stolen pallet by a monitoring station computer 26 equipped with GPS map.
