</font><BR>
<BR><CENTER><B>Abstract</B></CENTER>
<P>The smart medical compliance method and system invention prevents adverse
     drug events through the use of protocols that uniquely identifies the
     patient, care provider, medication and/or medical device that is to be
     used with <B><I>radio frequency identification (RFID</I></B>). The <B><I>RFID</I></B> devices
     incorporate fail-safe locks or indicators that prevent the inadvertent or
     unauthorized use of medication, medical devices, or medical supplies. The
     system corroborates, patient, the care provider, the medical device, and
     the manner in which it is to be used, and authorizes the action to be
     undertaken through an interface on a personal digital assistant PDA over
     a wireless communication channel. The system also timestamps events in
     the equivalent of a medical black box such that records may be kept to
     further improve patient care and allow an analysis of procedures. In
     addition, the system includes interfaces to medication preparation and
     safe disposal. A number of smart devices that interact with the system
     are also described. These include smart medical containers, smart clamps,
     smart valves, smart syringes, smart couplers, smart pipettes, and a host
     of other point of care devices.

<CENTER><B><I>Description</B></I></CENTER>
<HR>
<BR><BR>[0001]This invention relates to a system for providing patient care at a
     point of care (POC).
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002]Currently there is a heightened demand for improvements in patient
     point of care (POC). Errors and other incidents are inevitable in complex
     systems, and hence, mitigating medical errors through the use of
     technology and protocols via systems engineering is desirable. Over the
     past several years there has been increased emphasis on the reporting and
     analysis of POC errors. Some of the more prominent errors are erroneous
     patient identification, drug administration, and medication
     administration recording.
<BR><BR>[0003]It is estimated that approximately 36% of adverse drug events occur
     at the patient POC while only 2% are intercepted [JAMA, 1995]. In
     addition to POC errors, there are other sources of errors including
     prescription, transcription, and dispensing. It is recognized that any
     effective system or technology for improving POC will need to be
     integrated within the context of a complete patient care management
     system.
<BR><BR>[0004]The benefits to modernization of health management through
     information technology are often easily seen only once adopted. An
     electronic records system (ERS) introduces consistency into the process
     and with sufficient standards decrease errors in information gathering
     and processing. Practitioners like the fact that if they write a
     prescription, the prescription is automatically recorded. Furthermore,
     (personal digital assistant) PDA software can refer to the hospital or
     clinical system's database and list any potential interactions between
     the prescribed medication and other medications that the patient may
     already be taking.
<BR><BR>[0005]Advancements in information and communication technology (ICT) and
     their adoption in healthcare necessitate a "system's approach." Systems
     approaches include human factors engineering (HFE) as well as technology
     engineering. HFE attempts to identify situations that give rise to human
     errors and implement "system changes" to reduce their occurrence and
     minimize their impact on patients. This perspective, which strives to
     catch human errors before they occur, or block them from causing harm, is
     argued to be more effective and realizable than attempting to create an
     error free or flawless system. In this regard, technology engineering can
     be used in conjunction with HFE to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
     protocols and practice with a similar objective of reducing errors.
     Systems Engineering implies the increased use of tools such as those for
     failure mode and effects analysis and root cause analysis (FMEA and RCA).
<BR><BR>[0006]There are also a number of mobile devices and wireless communication
     technologies that will play a major role in modernizing medical and
     health systems. Security is also an issue that needs to be addressed
     thoroughly and implemented properly to be effective as Clinical Grade
     Networks are developed and deployed.
<BR><BR>[0007]"Smart" RFID devices are another technology that has the potential
     to improve patient safety and quality of care. Promising technologies and
     methodologies for improving patient POC and reducing errors include those
     based on barcodes and RFID. These technologies are not new and have been
     in commercial use for well over twenty years. They are however becoming
     more main-stream as both supporting electronic technology improves and
     connectivity protocols become standardized. One of the problems with
     early adoption of both RFID and barcodes is that they are inherently
     submissive, allowing for identification with little or no support for
     interactivity and automation.
<BR><BR>[0008]Conventional applications of RFID technology in healthcare are
     primarily those based upon identification. These enable systems to be
     built around inventory tracking and control. Extensions include
     pharmaceutical supply chain inventory and tracking for medical
     reconciliation. Tied into a hospital management system, they have
     considerable potential to reduce adverse drug events at the patient POC.
     This is accomplished through corroboration of the patient ID with the
     drug prescribed by the physician.
<BR><BR>[0009]In U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,139,495 issued Oct. 31, 2000; 6,032,155 issued
     Feb. 29, 2000 and 6,529,466 all of de la Huerga together with a number of
     further patents by the same Applicant is disclosed a system of
     controlling the supply of medication or medical events to a patient by a
     health care worker with the intention of reducing accidental incorrect
     procedures on patients.
<BR><BR>[0010]In U.S. Pat. No. 6,897,374 issued May 24.sup.th 2005, the Colder
     Products Company were granted priority on a connector and apparatus and
     method for connecting the same; however, in their invention they require
     an "RFID Reader" on a female end for the act or engagement of coupling.
     Furthermore, their device requires a hard wired connection to supplement
     data communications and power for actuation/control. In the smart
     coupler, invention described here, the mating ends require only and RFID
     tag 838 and associated electronics (or RFID system on a chip), as opposed
     to an actual RFID Reader. The control of the smart coupler invention is
     accomplished by way of a hand held PDA or mobile computer 115, with the
     actuation either being manual (human operator) or automatic (on board
     electromechanical latch) in nature. The design also benefits from a
     standardization in which both coupling ends are identical in detail. It,
     therefore, requires the insertion of an intermediate channel or gateway,
     which serves the purpose of a sterile channel to be discarded or recycled
     after use. (There is no intermediate channel in the embodiment of the
     invention described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,897,374 issued May 24.sup.th
     2005.)
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0011]It is one object of the present invention to provide an improved
     system of this general type.
<BR><BR>[0012]According to the invention there is provided a system for providing
     patient care at a point of care (POC) comprising:

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>[0084]This invention presents RFID technology within a medical context and
     introduces novel designs using enhanced RFID devices (system and
     methodology) for integration within evolving and legacy POC systems. It
     provides a conceptual overview of the point of care interacting
     components within the medical reconciliation and compliance platform. A
     smart medical device and its system of deployment include methods of
     identification and control for medical compliance. Identification is
     accomplished with the aid of RFID, while control is enabled through a
     mechanism that can be activated to prevent improper or unauthorized
     access.
<BR><BR>[0085]Smart RFID devices attempt to facilitate error-free dispensing and
     administration (of medication and/or medical supplies), and other
     clinical practices, to reduce or prevent adverse medical events, near
     misses, or sentinel events. These devices may incorporate an RFID enabled
     electromechanical lock or latch controlling their access and include
     smart medical containers, smart clamps, smart valves, smart syringes and
     pipettes, smart IV pumps, smart couplers, and smart bandages. The RFID
     tags on these devices can be either active or passive, and the control
     and communication can be derived from the interaction of an RFID reader
     and tag in conjunction with the associated electronics and overseeing
     medical information management system.
<BR><BR>[0086]RFID enabled devices come with an associated overhead, but are not
     superfluous in deployment, and can be used within the framework of an
     engineered POC system. The designs disclosed herein offer seamless
     integration with purposeful function, and an evolutionary path to
     improved overall medical compliance. Future RFID devices will extend
     beyond traditional uses--even the "smart" applications disclosed here.
     Such RFID devices will incorporate various sensors and will be widely
     available as implantable devices.
<BR><BR>[0087]RFID technology utilization is gaining momentum and is being
     tailored to a number of applications. Although there are a variety of
     RFID tags and systems, those best suited to health care have a number of
     differentiating characteristics. More specifically, an RFID transponder
     or tag in a medical application will require data capacities that range
     from a few bytes to several kilobytes. In contrast there are 1-bit
     transponders which provide information only on their presence. Although
     inexpensive, and likely to be widely applied in commercial environments,
     they are less likely to find much utility in a health setting.
<BR><BR>[0088]RFID transponders that allow for sufficient data require an
     integrated circuit and have more stringent power requirements. This power
     can be derived through an interrogating electromagnetic field of a
     reader, or supplied by an on-board battery. Typically, an RFID
     transponder will interact with a reader in one of two ways: either
     simultaneously interacting (with a reader) over a modulated channel, or
     in a sequential manner, where the reader switches off the interrogating
     field allowing for the transponder on the tag to respond during a
     quiescent period.
<BR><BR>[0089]In addition to requiring data storage, a health related RFID system
     will also require security beyond that found in many commercial
     applications. Security protocols and their processing imply an additional
     constraint upon the energy requirements of the RFID device itself. Many
     medical RFID devices will also be required to interact with a sensor,
     activate a solenoid or motor (or other electromechanical device) thereby
     increasing the power requirements still further.
<BR><BR>[0090]Medical RFID devices could also be programmable and reusable. The
     reuse implies an additional constraint that may require the device to be
     subject to temperature, chemical, and/or electronic processes, not
     otherwise needed in less sterile environments. As with other medical
     devices, clinical grade medical RFID devices will be required to meet the
     stringent standards of various governing bodies and institutions of the
     health industry. Clinical grade RFID devices will also be required to
     meet rigorous EMI and EMC (electromagnetic interference and
     compatibility) guidelines.
<BR><BR>[0091]The frequency of operation for RFID devices fall into several broad
     ranges reflecting that of the reader. These range from RF (MHz) to
     microwave (GHz). The physical operating proximity of devices is also an
     important issue in a medical setting. It is likely that close coupling
     (&lt;1 cm) would contravene the existing protocol of a POC practitioner.
     Remote coupling (0-1 m) would allow for the functionality of the RFID
     device without compromising the protocol of the practitioner or care
     provider who may be wearing the reader/transceiver on his or her wrist or
     belt.
<BR><BR>[0092]The basic operation of an inductively coupled 13.56 MHz (ISM band)
     RFID transponder (tag) is as follows. The transponder couples with the RF
     field of the reader. In this case the reader is operating at 13.56 MHz.
     The transponder is tuned to this frequency (powered by the ambient field
     of the reader) and modulates a sub-carrier with the code (ID) stored on
     the transponder. This code effectively load-modulates the impedance seen
     by the reader at sideband frequencies on the order of +/-424 KHz. This
     provides a sideband that is filtered by the transceiver of the reader and
     demodulated to determine the ID of the transponder. Variations on this
     basic idea include alternative coding or keying as well as modulation
     methods. Data integrity is a crucial aspect of an RFID system in a
     medical application. At the lowest level the most effective and efficient
     error control check is that provided by a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).
     In theory a CRC provides error aliasing performance on the order of one
     part in 2.sup.n, where n is degree of the CRC polynomial, or
     equivalently, the number of bits associated with the CRC register. A CRC
     is easily implemented in minimal hardware consisting of D type Flip-flops
     and a small number of exclusive-or gates. In RFID operation the
     transponder transmits its data (e.g., ID and sensor data) and a CRC is
     calculated within the transponder and this value appended to the
     transmitted block of data. The reader calculates the CRC on the received
     data, (e.g., ID, sensor data, and appended CRC). If this CRC is zero
     (easily checked in hardware) the received data is assumed to be error
     free. One precautionary note is that the aliasing behavior of an n-bit
     CRC being 1 in 2n is typically an asymptotic result, and hence, an
     overestimate of the actual error performance. The relatively limited size
     of medical RFID data actually places the aliasing performance of the CRC
     in its transient analysis domain. As such, further analysis of the CRC
     and its behavior should be undertaken if it is to be used in critical
     medical RFID environments.
<BR><BR>[0093]If the aliasing behavior of the CRC is not sufficient, simple
     additional error control, such as redundant reading or polling, can
     easily be implemented without having to resort to stronger error control
     techniques.
<BR><BR>[0094]An incorrect CRC is an indication of at least one bit in error
     resulting from interference, or a weak signal to noise ratio. If one is
     interested in securing the data in a manner ensuring integrity and
     authenticity, a public key encryption standard such as RSA can be
     implemented. With strong encryption, however, there is a computational
     requirement that may be difficult to budget for on an extremely low power
     device. Public key encryption offers easier key management than secret
     key systems, but at the expense of having higher computational
     requirements. If hardware efficiency and security are required, a public
     key system can be used to exchange a secret key that can be implemented
     in a streaming cipher, not significantly more complicated than the CRC
     physical layer protection, as previously discussed. Issues such as
     renewal of the secret key will have to be taken into account if one is to
     guard against simple replay attacks or forgeries. Fortunately, many of
     these techniques are being addressed within the wireless LAN community
     and can be modified or redeployed within an RFID environment.
<BR><BR>[0095]In addition to issues associated with general RFID operation (error
     control and security) multiple-access within a medical environment
     requires consideration. It is envisioned that with many medical
     applications a reader may be in close proximity to a number of RFID
     transponders. The problem of multiple-access within a shared medium has
     been encountered and addressed in wired technologies such as 802.3
     (Ethernet) as well as wireless technologies such as 802.11x. A difficulty
     with respect to wireless technologies, in general, is that if a
     transponder is broadcasting it can not hear other transponders that may
     also be broadcasting--making it basically a free-for-all with collisions
     severely limiting throughput. However, it should be noted that the
     efficiency of an RFID system may not be as adversely affected as other
     radio systems for the following two reasons: one, the number of
     transponders in the spatial vicinity of an interrogating reader is
     anticipated to be relatively small; and, two, the amount of data is also
     relatively small. For instance, a protocol utilizing a simple windowed
     access mechanism of 16 slots, with 5 transponders, contending for a
     slotted channel in a random access fashion (supporting a data rate on the
     order of 25 Kbits/sec, and an average read time of 30 msec,) the
     probability of successful packet reception would be 77%. As such, within
     a short period (less than 3 windows, 1.5 sec.) all 5 RFID transponders
     would be read with high probability (0.99). If this simple scheme were
     not sufficient, a reader could poll individual RFID transponders in a
     similar manner to other radio contention resolution schemes. This of
     course requires that the transponder be provisioned with sufficient
     electronics to respond when queried--as an individual device or within a
     group or transponders. In either case, it should be noted that collision
     avoidance may be an issue in a medical setting and requires proper
     engineering consideration.
<BR><BR>Smart Medical Compliance System and Platform
<BR><BR>[0096]FIG. 1a is a diagram illustrating a system 100a for the smart
     medical compliance system, and interacting medical components, as an
     example of the embodiment of the invention. The system 100a may be
     implemented in a healthcare facility, hospital, personal care home,
     clinic, laboratory, etc., wherever there is an existing and supporting
     information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure. The
     conventional or legacy ICT infrastructure (and the connectivity of the
     facility), from a Systems Engineering perspective, is not shown (for
     simplification) in the illustration of FIG. 1a. That is, existing
     interfaces and communication channels are omitted in the System's view of
     the smart medical compliance system for purposes of clarity only. It
     should be understood that some of these channels are available to the
     smart medical compliance system and may indeed be shared. Some of the
     departments or entities which may have their own established independent
     communications channels (outside of the smart medical compliance system
     and its middleware) are the care provider or clinical technician 114, the
     overseeing physician 118, the pharmacy 119, the central medical
     processing unit 101, the central supply unit 104, and the patient 106.
<BR><BR>[0097]The following defined communication links (in some instances) may be
     understood as being visual, auditory (as in verbal communication), or
     gesturing (as in sign-language), (as in verbal communication) in nature,
     or actual hard wired or wireless data/information communication channels.
     The default implication is that the links are either hard wired or
     wireless data communication channels. The visual or auditory channels of
     communication will be mentioned or described explicitly in the correct
     context so as to eliminate any possibility of confusion. Depending on the
     kind of smart medical device/apparatus and its communication requirements
     (i.e., medium or long range wireless, or near field communications, NFC),
     wireless communication may be ubiquitous in or outside the facility as
     long as there is an active communication channel available via wireless
     access points. It should be noted that, as illustrated in FIG. 1a, RFID
     tags are denoted as "(RFID)" as in the overseeing physician's RFID tag
     117, the pharmacist's RFID tag 139, the patient's RFID tag 107, and the
     smart medical device's RFID tag 111. On the other hand, an RFID reader is
     denoted as "RFID Reader," as in the pharmacist's RFID Reader 135, the
     central processing unit's RFID Reader 102, the central medical supply
     unit's RFID Reader 105, the care provider's RFID Reader 116, and the
     smart medical devices RFID Reader (not shown, but there is an option to
     add one for certain devices, or in certain circumstances--as in the
     deployment of say a smart medical container).
<BR><BR>[0098]The smart medical compliance ICT (information and communication
     technology) system 108 is interfaced to a hospital and/or clinical and/or
     laboratory information system 137 via communication link 132. The smart
     medical compliance ICT system 108 is interfaced to persons such as the
     patient 106 (monitoring), the care provider or qualified worker (or
     clinician, or technician) 114, and/or the overseeing physician 118 (can
     be generally referred to as the primary care providers 113) and/or
     pharmacist 119. These persons are identified by their RFID tags thereby
     identifying the patient 107, the care provider 134, and/or the overseeing
     physician 117 and/or pharmacist 139. The care provider and/or overseeing
     physician 118 also has a mobile Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) or
     handheld computer 115 and RFID reader 116. Although it is not explicitly
     shown, the overseeing physician can also have a mobile PDA or hand held
     device. (This fact is covered in the illustration of FIG. 1a by noting
     that the overseeing physician and the care provider, clinician, or
     technician, may be one in the same person, i.e., a "general" health care
     provider 133.) The smart medical compliance ICT system 108 can
     communicate with the patient 106 via communication link 126 (in the event
     that monitoring is required--for instance, as in intensive care vital
     sign monitoring). Furthermore, the smart medical compliance ICT system
     108 can also communicate with the care provider 114 via communication
     link 127 and with the overseeing physician 118 via communication link
     128.
<BR><BR>[0099]The smart medical compliance ICT system 108 is interfaced to
     departments such as pharmacy 119, central medical supply unit 104, and
     the central medical processing unit 101. Pharmacy 119 is equipped with an
     RFID reader 135, and can communicate with the smart medical compliance
     ICT system 108 via communication link 120. The central medical processing
     unit 101 is equipped with an RFID reader 102, and can communicate with
     the smart medical compliance ICT system 108 via communication link 138.
     The central medical processing unit 101 is also equipped with a disposal,
     sterilization (and reconstitution) unit 103. The central medical supply
     unit 104 is equipped with an RFID reader 105, and can communicate with
     the smart medical compliance ICT system 108 via communication link 125.
     Pharmacy 119 (or the pharmacist, RFID tag 139) can communicate with the
     central medical supply unit 104 via communication link 121. The central
     medical processing unit 101 can communicate with the central medical
     supply unit 104 via communication link 123.
<BR><BR>[0100]An example of a smart medical device is represented by 110. These
     include, but are not exclusive to, smart containers, smart clamps, smart
     valves, smart syringes, smart pipettes, smart bandages, smart catheters,
     and a plethora of smart surgical tools, devices, and apparatuses. The
     smart medical device 110 includes an RFID tag 111, medical content and/or
     apparatus 112, RFID and associated interface (such as RFID system on a
     chip and other electronics and computing hardware) 109. The smart medical
     device 110 can communicate with the care provider 114 and/or physician
     118 (visually or audibly) or via communication links 130 and 131. The
     smart medical device 110 can also communicate with the pharmacy 119 via
     communication link 133 (at the point of preparation, at the patient point
     of care, in surgery, or even anywhere within the facility as long as
     there is a communication channel available). The smart medical device 110
     can communicate with the patient directly (visually or audibly) or the
     patient's RFID 107 via communication link 129, and with the central
     medical supply unit 104 via communication link 124. It should be noted
     that depending on the kind of smart medical device/apparatus to be
     deployed, its point of preparation may be in Pharmacy or the central
     medical processing lab, or both, at which time the smart medical
     device/apparatus can be programmed and prepared for the deployment within
     the facility or for home use on an out patient basis.
<BR><BR>[0101]Pertaining to a more human factors involvement in the "chain of
     command" of facility operations, the care provider 114 can communicate
     with the central medical processing unit via communication link 122.
     Moreover, the care provider 114 can also communicate with the patient 106
     verbally, or with sign-language, and/or via communication link 136. This
     data or signal communication path is established using the RFID Reader
     116 and mobile PDA 115 for the reading and/or (re-)programming the RFID
     tag 107 (wristband tag) on the patient. This may simply be for the
     purpose of positive identification (for corroboration), prior to the
     commencement of a medical procedure, so that a patient does not receive
     an incorrect or unassigned medical treatment leading up to an adverse
     event, near miss, or sentinel event. This may also be for the purpose of
     updating (or uploading) or downloading the patient's "on-board" tag's
     point of care (or surgery) record/history, or other medial records. In
     this way, it is possible that every administration, procedure, or service
     can be logged/transmitted not only to the main information management
     system and data base via the mobile PDA 115, but to the RFID tag 107
     itself where it will reside in memory to be polled or interrogated at a
     later time perhaps even by other departments. This can be a useful
     feature (for department personnel) in determining the status of a patient
     when he/she is transferred from department to department for various
     medical testing/tests.
<BR><BR>Health Information Technology Management System
<BR><BR>[0102]The health IT system 137 is system is responsible for the entire
     health information and communication technology (ICT) for an entire
     healthcare and/or laboratory facility. This system is comprised of
     several components. However, at the heart of the system is the electronic
     medical records and medical administration records system which includes
     patient information data bases, and storage systems for medical imaging
     (CAT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.) and medical or laboratory tests. Other
     services such as billing, accounting, inventory, payroll, and human
     resources, may be performed as well.
<BR><BR>[0103]The "middleware" of the described smart medical compliance system
     100a interfaces the main medical information system (or the hospital
     information technology IT system 137) with a smart medical compliance ICT
     management system 108. This includes a heath black box (time stamping)
     record database 101b and an "expert system" 102b responsible for
     workflow, protocol and practices expert system. Its deployment is
     primarily for the safe and efficient management of heath care procedures,
     services, and personnel, at the patient point of care and surgery, in
     facilities such as hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and personal care
     homes.
<BR><BR>Pharmacological Preparation and Dispensing (Pharmacy)
<BR><BR>[0104]An instance of medical compliance is realized at the pharmacological
     preparation and preparation/dispensing point. In this scenario, the
     pharmacist 119 is required to correctly identify himself via RFID tag 135
     and fill a prescription with the appropriate medication or supply, etc.,
     for the corresponding patient 106--as well as identify the care provider
     113 who is responsible for the actual act of prescription (overseeing
     physician 118) and administration (care provider 114). It should be noted
     that the pharmacist would also be responsible for the correct preparation
     of smart medical devices/apparatuses 110 (and its contents, in the case
     of a smart medical container) to be handed off ultimately to the care
     provider 114 to perform the actual administration of the medical content
     (i.e., medication, preparations, supplies).
<BR><BR>Central Medical Processing and Supply Units: Recycling--Disposal.
     Sterilization, Reuse, and Distribution
<BR><BR>[0105]The Smart medical device/apparatus operational components may
     require sterilization for safe reusability. Proper handling and disposal
     protocol (i.e., Bio-hazard compliance) may require that an RFID Disposal
     Reader log the RFID tag of the smart medical device/apparatus and
     time-stamp the disposal, sending this information back to the main
     information management or records system. Even the reconstitution of the
     smart medical device/apparatus for re-use may require time-stamping in
     its preparation prior to redistribution. Furthermore, the smart medical
     device/apparatus can be "programmed" or initialized to identify itself
     and/or its content and components for proper disposal, re-sterilization,
     reconstitution, or recycling. A secure tamper-proof inlay indicator may
     be affixed (if required) at this point of preparation.
<BR><BR>[0106]Moreover, the central medical processing 101 and central medical
     supply 104 facilities can also perform a vital service in the supply and
     distribution of smart medical devices/apparatuses. Using RFID Readers in
     conjunction with the smart medical devices (and perhaps any or all of
     their contents/components, which may also be "RFID tagged") at various
     stages of disposal, recycling, or reconditioning, the process of reading
     (downloading) or reprogramming/resetting of their RFID tags (or RFID
     systems on a chip) can reveal critical information related to issues of
     supply and inventory management. This acquired information can be used in
     the operations management of the facility. For instance, knowledge
     related to utilization and duty cycle (or the number of times the devices
     have been placed in service) can be used by the central medical supply
     unit 104 in the planning of inventory or storage (including the
     distribution, location, and co-location of stock). The numbers of smart
     medical devices/apparatuses in the field and their identification can
     also be readily obtained. When this is combined with tracking and
     location detection systems (also using RFID or other similar
     identification and location technology) a plethora of useful or even
     critical information can be made available to managers and other
     authorized personnel in the facility.
<BR><BR>Medical Content Disposal
<BR><BR>[0107]After administering medical content or performing a medical
     procedure or service via a smart medical device--at the time of proper
     disposal--the RFID tag of any residual medical content (or expended
     medical devices) could be re-read and the event time-stamped. An RFID
     reader located on a disposal chute or disposal apparatus could read the
     RFID tag of the expended medical content, time-stamp the event, and send
     this information back to a central main medical information management or
     patient medical records data base system. Hence, this information can be
     used to "close the loop" on when and where the medical content was
     administered providing an ancillary level of medical compliance. The
     reading of the RFID tag of the expended medical content and/or smart
     medical device/apparatus at time of disposal is useful even if the RFID
     enabled latchable/lockable device or its contents or components were not
     used. The disposal RFID reader would simply log the identification of the
     RFID tag of the smart medical device/apparatus, its components, or its
     residual medical content, and time-stamp the event sending this
     confirmation message or signal back to the main medical information or
     patient medical records data base system.
<BR><BR>Security (Tamper-Proof Inlay) Indicator
<BR><BR>[0108]A security "trip-wire" (conductive strip/trace, decal, inlay, or
     pin, security seal) can be incorporated into a smart medical
     device/apparatus affixed or attached by adhesive or glue (or other
     fastening means, using for example, screws or pins) as a "tamper-proof"
     or "breach" indicator. This passive or electrically conductive inlay
     strip or decal is placed over the latch/lock, or attached to a movable
     (pivoting/sliding/rotating) structure and housing embodiment, which
     precludes access to the gate/door or latch, or the operation therein of
     the smart medical device, respectively, only to be removed by authorized
     personnel with proper protocol and practice. The removal would entail the
     eradication of a tab on the security seal, or otherwise of some portion
     thereof, and in doing so activating the "compromised" state of the smart
     medical device/apparatus--indicating that a breach has occurred in the
     process. One method of accomplishing this is with the use of a simple
     visual indicator in the form of an inlay or decal made or designed to be
     obvious to an operator (or others) in determining if it is breached,
     destroyed, or tampered with. On the other hand, the security seal of a
     smart medical device/apparatus can also be electrically or mechanically
     connected to dedicated smart medical device/apparatus alarm circuitry. It
     can also be attached or affixed to an entirely separate RFID inlay or the
     already residing RFID electrical circuitry itself (or RFID system on a
     chip) responsible for the control or actuation of higher order smart
     medical device/apparatus functionality. If the inlay, strip, or pin is
     electrically coupled in either of these manners, an alert signal can be
     activated in event that the "sealed" or securely prepared smart medical
     device/apparatus has been inadvertently or deliberately opened or tamped
     with. This is an incorporated security feature to ensure that the medical
     device/apparatus and its associated contents have not been tampered with.
     Indication of a broken or tampered seal can be revealed on the smart
     medical device/apparatus itself either visually, audibly, or both,
     through dedicated alarm electrical circuitry. It can also be manifested
     by way of a "state-change" through the onboard RFID electrical circuitry
     (which can be polled or interrogated by the RFID reader) whose status can
     be indicated on the display screen and/or speaker of a hand-held
     computer, PDA, or mobile device/cart, to be relayed to an overseeing
     information management system. In this way, a visual (e.g., flashing Red
     light) or unique audio alarm indicator or can be incorporated in the
     smart medical device/apparatus itself (and/or a separate supporting
     monitoring device) as an indication of content integrity. This will help
     ensure security, proper compliance, and administration integrity in a
     medical setting. In the event that the integrity of a smart medical
     device/apparatus has been compromised, the overseeing medical management
     system can make a determination regarding clinical or laboratory <B><I>security
     protocol</I></B> and practices to alert those authorized parties in charge or
     responsible for circumventing any potential wrongdoings or criminal
     behaviors
<BR><BR>Smart Medical Compliance ICT System
<BR><BR>[0109]FIG. 1b is a diagram of the smart medical compliance information and
     communication (ICT) system 100b which illustrates the smart medical
     compliance information and communication (ICT) system or component 108 of
     the overall smart medical compliance system or platform 100a of FIG. 1a.
     The smart medical compliance information and communication (ICT) system
     depicted in 100b is comprised of components (or sub-components). These
     components include a health black-box 101b (providing time stamping) with
     record data base, and an (intelligent, or simple) expert system 102b
     managing operations related to personnel work flow, protocols and
     practice, of and within the facility.
<BR><BR>Health Black-Box (Time Stamping)
<BR><BR>[0110]The health black box 101b is a subsystem that records information
     related to medical and/or clinical practices in laboratories and/or at
     the point of care, including surgery (using mobile PDAs or hand held
     computers, in conjunction with smart medical devices/apparatuses), at
     testing and treatment locations (using a variety of computer and
     communications services and technologies that may be available, such as,
     desktop computers, mobile carts with computers, mobile PDAs or handheld
     computers, or computer interfaces on the actual testing or treatment
     machines themselves)--wherever there may be a care provider,
     practitioner, clinician, or technician with an RFID Reader who is part of
     the overall smart medical compliance infrastructure. The information
     recorded by such a system may only be accessible to authorized personnel,
     such as, operations managers, safety and quality of care professionals
     and executives, and policy makers within the facility, or even of a
     higher authority (standards bodies, or government), with the
     responsibility of improving, maintaining, and assuring a certain level or
     standard of healthcare practice. This system can if so desired be
     programmed to automatically alert authorized and assigned personnel of
     any breach or collapse in policy or practices, and/or any medical errors
     (adverse events, near misses, or sentinel events) than may have occurred
     requiring attention for immediate intervention or improvement, or for
     sometime (according to set protocol and practices) at a later date/time.
<BR><BR>Expert System (Workflow, Protocol, and Practice Manager)
<BR><BR>[0111]The expert system 102b is responsible for personnel workflow,
     protocols, and practices, in and within the facility. By definition, it
     is an automated system for performing logical deductions and inferences
     from a set of known facts which are embedded in knowledge based rules.
     This system is also capable of making new inferences (without
     intervention) on new facts by exercising these rules via software running
     on a computer as part of the smart medical compliance ICT system 108,
     100b. Information is propagated through communications channels to and
     from receiving and transmitting devices (e.g., mobile computers, and
     smart medical devices/apparatuses) comprising a significant component of
     the overall smart medical compliance system 100a. As it relates to the
     smart medical compliance system and method, these rules form the basis of
     logically managing the clinical practices of working personnel. The
     "appropriate" or "desirable" working practices and conditions can be
     inserted or programmed in the system, for instance, by those skilled in
     systems (human factors) engineering and operations management, in such a
     manner, as to make for safe and efficient medical delivery, practices,
     and standards within the facility.
<BR><BR>[0112]Smart medical devices/apparatuses 110 can be "enabled" or "disabled"
     according to such a set policy, for the main goal of significantly
     reducing medical errors, to in turn, improve safety, efficiency, and
     quality of care. Of course, along with achieving reduced errors are the
     several cost saving benefits that can be realized: less patient
     hospitalization time, fewer law suits (litigation cases), less
     re-testing, and more efficient uses of resources. There are also the
     costs savings that are attributed to avoiding a bad reputation (which is
     extremely important as healthcare facilities are constantly being rated
     and scrutinized) to facilities which are at less risk for incurring
     significant medical errors. It should be also noted that there are
     efficiencies to be accrued by having working staff members operate in a
     timely and efficient manner. They may also increase their productivity if
     their work is less stressful and more enjoyable, yielding to less sick
     leaves or injuries on the job--and leading to further cost saving
     benefits.
<BR><BR>[0113]This expert system is also responsible in handling workflow in the
     event of adverse or extenuating circumstances. For example, if a care
     provider is called to an emergency, he/she can enter a "state" or code
     via their PDA to indicate that were "called away" to a more pressing
     medical issue. The expert system, after being made aware of the pending
     emergency and "sign-off" of the care provider, will "call in" (notify) a
     substitute worker (through their PDA) to perform the previously
     assigned/pending medical task in a seamless fashion. If on the other
     hand, the medical task is not performed, an open "loop" will be
     recognized, and another option may be exercised, depending on the policy
     programmed into the expert system (such as warning delivered to one's
     PDA, or to a higher authority). A hierarchy is embedded in the expert
     system designed for assigning and reassigning work flow duties to find
     qualified and available personnel. Also embedded in these rules are
     protocols at the point of care in the event of device failure, whereby
     replacement procedures are governed by the expert system. The same is can
     is true for re-staffing (due to shift changes and holidays).
<BR><BR>Ubiquitous or Pervasive Health Computing Environment
<BR><BR>[0114]The described smart medical compliance, method and system (and its
     smart medical devices/apparatuses 110) can be envisaged to subsist within
     a ubiquitous or pervasive health computing environment. In this manner,
     small embedded computers (mobile PDAs, or hand held computers 115) would
     respond to one's presence, desires, and needs, without the operator
     necessarily being solely responsible for all active manipulation within
     one's environment. This can be accomplished with the benefit of a health
     expert system 102b. A network of fixed and mobile wireless devices would
     allow for communications so as to seamlessly integrate the operator's
     intentions and even perform tasks automatically. This will rid the
     operator of the more error-prone, mundane, and arduous tasks, freeing up
     time necessary to focus on the primary task at hand. In this manner,
     their work and other unexpectedly assigned activities should be made
     easier (and perhaps even more enjoyable) while their presence is more
     transparent, making for a less intrusive and invasive practice.
<BR><BR>Smart Medical Compliance: Operation and Protocol
<BR><BR>[0115]It is envisaged that the smart medical devices/apparatuses 110
     operator (i.e., care provider 113) at the point of dissemination would
     have an RFID tag 134 and RFID Reader 116, with a personal digital
     assistant (PDA) 115 or other portable or mobile wired/wireless hand held
     computer (integrated or stand alone). In this instance, a mobile computer
     (cart) or PDA is capable of communicating with a smart medical
     device/apparatus 110 and concurrently capable of communicating with the
     main information management or records system. This later communication
     could be provided through a wireless or wired network, intranet,
     Internet, cellular or telephone system. As previously mentioned, with
     respect to the hand held computer 115, the RFID Reader 116 could be
     attached, built in, or detachable, with wired or wireless communication
     or stand alone capability (as is the case with a universal smart key,
     described below).
<BR><BR>[0116]The protocol of operation calls for the operator to interrogate the
     RFID tag (wristband tag) of the patient 107 and of the smart medical
     device/apparatus 110, with the handheld PDA 115 RFID Reader 116, and upon
     corroboration (matching the correct identity of the patient 106 and the
     smart medical device/apparatus 110 with the desired actuation state) the
     smart device/apparatus 110 could be electromechanically unlocked (or
     unlatched) and the smart medical device/apparatus mechanism enabled or
     prepared for actuation. (The process of authentication can also include a
     biometric interface (for patient 106 and care provider identification
     114, or 118, to further corroborate operator access, permissions, and
     authority.)
<BR><BR>[0117]The process described above can also provide services including
     time-stamps, sensor information acquisition, and operational data
     collection--that may optionally be logged back to the health black box
     record database 101b of the smart medical ICT system 101b or even the
     main health information management records system through this gateway.
<BR><BR>[0118]A "failsafe protocol" can also be affected by the expert system 102b
     within the scope of the present smart medical compliant method and system
     100a. In the event of smart medical device/apparatus 110 failure, the
     operator (care provider 114 or qualified technician) has prior knowledge
     and procedures for overriding and replacing the malfunctioning smart
     medical devices/apparatuses 110 without compromising intended purpose,
     operation, and functionality. The smart medical device/apparatus performs
     "self test diagnostics" periodically, upon power up, shut down, or query.
     In this manner, any anomaly will be reported to the care provider or
     qualified and authorized technicians for override, repair, or
     intervention. The onboard intelligence of the smart medical
     device/apparatus itself will provide an audio or visual warning, or
     through wireless communication, provide a warning to the screen of the
     hand held PDA 115 or mobile computer, notifying the operator or qualified
     technician of a hardware failure (or pending failure). The operator may
     now invoke an override procedure to manually bypass the failure and
     continue with intended smart medial device/apparatus function in
     compliance with failsafe protocol. The overall operation is not
     compromised since the failure mode has been recognized and recorded, thus
     allowing steps to be undertaken to repair or replace the defective smart
     device/apparatus in a controlled and monitored manner. This process is
     overseen by the smart medical compliance ICT management system 108 to
     conform to standards for minimizing the presence of a defective smart
     medical device/apparatus in the field. The compliance conforms to
     requirements within each field of application and deployment. The purpose
     is to safeguard against erroneous, unauthorized, malicious, or
     inadvertent (accidental) use, and moderate the handling, management, or
     replacement, of defective or obsolete devices. The actual override
     procedure is performed by an "authorized operator" or other authorized
     personnel (qualified technicians) utilizing a manual override procedure.
     The override personnel should have the necessary authority to
     reconstitute a replacement smart medical device/apparatus to a new or
     restored state or operational state. Any and all information gathered
     from the override procedure and replacement procedure would be accessible
     via the smart medical compliance ICT management system. All available
     information gathered via the mobile PDA, handheld, or cart computer can
     be communicated to the smart medical compliance ICT management system for
     real time feedback/notification and/or post incident investigation and
     analysis to a third party (hospital authorities, standards bodies, or
     policy makers).
<BR><BR>Smart Medical Therapy and Compliance
<BR><BR>[0119]At present a non-negligible number of medical incidences (adverse
     events, sentinel events, and near misses) occur comprising of errors and
     accidental and/or incorrect drug administrations to patients--as a direct
     result of ineffective identification and control practices and protocols.
     The invention described herein therefore relates to medication compliance
     at the patient 106/care-provider 114 interface (patient point of care,
     surgery, treatment, or testing), transport, supply, distribution 104,
     reconstitution 101, and/or pharmacological preparation and dispensing
     point 119. The device, method of deployment, and management system,
     addresses both identification and control. The identification is
     accomplished with the aid of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), while
     the control is provided through a mechanism that can be activated or
     deactivated (via RFID and associated electronics, and/or RFID System on
     chip technology) to prevent improper, erroneous, accidental, or
     unauthorized access, or to facilitate error-free preparation, dispensing,
     transportation/delivery, and administration of a medical preparation,
     service, or therapy.
<BR><BR>[0120]In one instance, at the patient point of care, the patient 106 and
     care provider 114 would be identified by their RFID tags 107, and 134,
     respectively, and the smart medical device/apparatus by its RFID tag 111.
     These devices would be affixed to the patient and care provider via a
     wrist strap (button, or clip-on broach, etc.) or other means, or perhaps
     implanted with bio-compatible RFID tags. The RFID tag can be affixed
     either directly or integrated to a smart medical device/apparatus 110, or
     as part of a wireless electronic computer module and associated
     electronics (or even RFID system on a chip). The point of care provider
     would have an RFID reader integrated or interfaced to a device (mobile
     handheld PDA or portable wired/wireless computer, or similar wearable
     device) capable of communicating with the smart medical compliance system
     and main patient data base and records system. In this scenario, the care
     provider would confirm the identification (ID) of one's self and the
     patient by a close proximity (near field communications, NFC) RFID scan,
     or otherwise, and in a similar manner, scan the smart medical
     device/apparatus prior to administering or performing the medical
     procedure. The mobile hand held computer, personal digital assistant
     (PDA), or portable mobile wired/wireless computer, would corroborate the
     correct correspondence among the care provider ID, the smart medical
     device/apparatus ID, and that of the ID of the patient.
<BR><BR>[0121]In an Operator-Responsible Mode, in the event that the ID of the
     care provider, patient, and smart medical device/apparatus were correct,
     that is, confirmation made between the RFID of the care provider,
     patient, smart medical device (with corresponding medical
     content/prescription), and the overseeing smart medical compliance
     system, then a "go" alarm (audible, visual, text, or otherwise) condition
     exists. This information is then conveyed to the care provider, so that
     he/she can proceed with the act of administration. On the other hand, in
     the event of an ID mismatch, or incorrect compliance determined by the
     smart medical compliance system, a notification also in the form of an
     alarm would indicate and convey the mismatch, indicating a "no-go"
     condition. At this point, it is the care provider's responsibility to
     cease the administration attempt immediately to prevent mishap and
     re-assess the task at hand.
<BR><BR>[0122]In a Fail-safe Mode, a second fail-safe mechanism can be included
     that would activate/deactivate a shut-off device, or latch, located on or
     within the smart medical device/apparatus itself, that would be
     enabled/disabled and/or moderate the administration according to the
     instructions received by the mobile hand held PDA computer or portable
     wired/wireless computer (near-real time information) and perhaps in
     conjunction with the smart medical compliance system. The activation (or
     lack of) would depend on the ID corroboration of the set--that being the
     smart medical device/apparatus, patient, and care provider, and the
     information communicated by the smart medical compliance system. For
     example, confirmation could be made by the portable wired/wireless
     computer of the care provider such that the RFID enabled device on a
     smart medical device/apparatus (smart syringe) would activate an unlock
     mechanism--permitting the commencement of injection of fluid to a
     patient. In the event that the smart syringe, patient, and care provider
     ID did not match, the smart syringe would not be enabled--and effectively
     remain shut-off or locked.
<BR><BR>[0123]In either of these modes of procurement, the time-stamp and event
     would be logged by the mobile or portable wired/wireless computer and
     smart medical compliance system 108 (black box 101b), and subsequently,
     the event recorded and stored in its data base and/or the main patient
     data base and records system.
<BR><BR>Physical Realization of Medical Device/Apparatus Latch/Lock Mechanism:
<BR><BR>[0124]The latch mechanism can include any of the following but are not
     limited by these:
<BR><BR>[0125]1. A simple rotation of a mechanical latch that can be in a variety
     of states. For example, a red indicator indicating do not use, a yellow
     indicator indicating that the prescription is in a prepared state, and a
     green indicator indicating that the smart medical device/apparatus is now
     unlatched and ready to use.
<BR><BR>[0126]2. An electromechanical latch, a stop or friction mechanism
     (Solenoid). This would be enabled by a separate power mechanism such as
     an on board battery, induced power through RFID device, piezo-electric
     effect, chemical, electrostatics, magnetics, or other mechanical to
     electrical transfer device.
<BR><BR>[0127]3. An electrochemical latch activated by electromagnetic energy
     (eg., Artificial muscle, Magneto-Rheological, electrochemical).
<BR><BR>[0128]4. A shape memory alloy latch activated by an electrical current or
     direct heat. This would be enabled by a separate power mechanism such as
     an on board battery, induced power through RFID device, piezo electric
     effect, chemical, electrostatics, magnetics, or other mechanical to
     electrical transfer device.
<BR><BR>[0129]5. A fuse or anti-fuse activated by current or electromagnetic, or
     chemical (possibly pyrotechnics) energy.
<BR><BR>[0130]6. A cantilever activated by electromagnetic energy (or heat, or
     light).
<BR><BR>[0131]In any case, the main idea is to use the RFID device to either
     directly or indirectly drive a "switch" to activate a latch/lock, thus
     enabling or disabling the syringe.
<BR><BR>Secure Channel Encryption for Smart Medical Device/Apparatus Communication
<BR><BR>[0132]The overall process of recording these (and previously described)
     operations is analogous to the data logging employed in the aviation
     industry utilizing a "Black Box." Other types of failure modes can be
     handled in a similar fashion under the guidance and instruction from the
     information management and compliance system. Such transactions (device
     status, time stamps, authorization, operations, etc.) and data storage
     can be made cryptographically secure preventing alteration or
     modification.
<BR><BR>[0133]The tracking and interoperable communication of smart medical
     devices/apparatus deployment could include suitable secure encryption
     methods. This will ensure reliable and confidential delivery and handling
     of critical data and secure control and actuation signals (or
     communication channels) for smart medical devices/apparatuses and
     operations management.
<BR><BR>Reading of Multiple RFID Tags
<BR><BR>[0134]There may instances when several RFID tags may have to read at the
     same time, by the correct positioning of the handheld RFID Reader. The
     process of reading several RFID tags may be critical in order to
     corroborate the medical compliance and warrant the proper operation of
     the smart medical device/apparatus and its ability to execute (deliver or
     administer) its services (treatment, testing, or monitoring). The smart
     medical compliance system and method 100a (and its accompanying hardware,
     software and middleware) incorporate this feature seamlessly in its
     operation.
<BR><BR>Alternative Communication and Activation Means:
<BR><BR>[0135]Smart medical devices/apparatuses can alternatively function by
     providing identification via an RFID tag, RFID System on a chip, Rubee,
     or HP-spot technology, etc. (all Radiofrequency communication
     technologies) while the actual indicator, locking/unlocking, and other
     control and information transmission signals, could be communicated to
     the smart medical device/apparatus using an auxiliary communication
     channel. Such channels could be standards such as 802.11x, 802.15.4,
     Bluetooth (Ericsson), Wibree (Nokia), ZigBee, HomeRF, Ultrawide band,
     802.16, Wireless USB, or a proprietary ad hoc wireless communication
     means. Furthermore, it should be noted that wireless infrared could also
     be the means of communication for interoperability, control, and
     information gathering. In effect, a smart medical device/apparatus can be
     interrogated using an RFID Reader while the control and actuation can be
     affected using an alternative communication channel or protocol. The
     preferred incarnation, however, is to obtain identification, status, and
     control, or actuate the syringe itself, using the bi-directional RFID
     communication capability via an RFID reader.
<BR><BR>[0136]In one instance, a micro RFID Reader/electronics could be collocated
     with the RFID tag and accompanying smart medical device/apparatus. Once
     the RFID tag is interrogated by the operator, and programmed accordingly,
     the response of the RFID tag could be read by the collocated micro RFID
     Reader/electronics and the appropriate action taken. The purpose of the
     collocated micro RFID Reader/electronics would be to support the
     requirement of flexibility in the interfacing of various sensors and
     actuators, thereby improving or extending the interfacing capability of
     the apparatus. This type of deployment could capitalize on standard
     off-the-shelf commercially available RFID tags whose standard electronic
     characteristics are either insufficient or unavailable to support or
     conform to the desired requirements.
<BR><BR>Smart Medical Devices/Apparatuses
<BR><BR>[0137]There are many point of care medical devices that can be made
     "smart." This would entail adding a certain amount of "intelligence" or
     capability for the purpose of increasing the level of functionality,
     scope, and application domain of the device. In doing so will make the
     device more suited to the task at hand. They include, but are no
     exclusive to, smart medical containers, smart clamps, smart valves, smart
     syringes and pipettes, smart couplers, and smart catheters. In the this,
     which can be transported by hand . . . .
<BR><BR>On-Board Visual and Audio State Indicators:
<BR><BR>[0138]A visual icon/graphic based or color coded indicator could be
     incorporated into the smart medical device/apparatus 110 serving as a
     "state" indicator for maintenance, replacement, or authorized (or
     unauthorized) access to an insecure latch, lockable-latch, or activation
     of the smart medical device/apparatus control or actuator mechanisms. For
     instance, a Red color indicator could correspond to a locked state, while
     a Green indicator could correspond to an unlocked state, denying or
     allowing access, respectively. Flashing lights can be used to indicate
     ready (not-ready) status or actual occupied/busy/in the process of
     activation status. The color indicators themselves may be passive (color
     swatches) or active, using light emitting diode (LED), liquid crystal
     display (LCD), digital light processor (DLP), or other comparable display
     technology.
<BR><BR>[0139]The smart medical device/apparatus 110 could also employ an audio
     indicator (i.e., speaker) incorporated into the smart medical
     device/apparatus 110 housing itself serving as an audio indicator for
     maintenance, replacement, or authorized (or unauthorized) access to an
     insecure latch, lockable-latch, or activation of the smart
     device/apparatus 110 control or actuator mechanisms. Reverberating audio
     can be used to indicate ready (not-ready) status or actual
     occupied/busy/in the process of activation status.
<BR><BR>[0140]It should also be understood that a visual or auditory signal can
     convey information to care provider 114 that the correct patient 106 is
     selected, the correct "smart" medical device 110 is selected, or even if
     the correct tubing or line is selected, since they can be RFID or simply
     color tagged.
<BR><BR>Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) Mobile Portal.
<BR><BR>[0141]It should also be noted that information can be conveyed to
     "authorized personnel" only through viewing screens and speakers of their
     personal computer, workstation, or mobile hand held or PDA devices 115,
     via signals transmitted through (hard wired, or wireless) communication
     channels. This can be accomplished so that the information is displayed
     in near-real time, whereby the operator has knowledge of the prevailing
     and pending processes and status, as the events occur, so that one may
     act or respond accordingly as one sees fit. In other words, this is the
     main human-computer interface (or portal) for conveying instruction and
     information about processes to the care provider 114. Furthermore, most
     of these devices have a key-pad, touch-sensitive screen, or stylist, for
     data enter and gaining access to information and database record systems.
<BR><BR>[0142]Utilizing the display of a PDA 115 can indicate (instruct) the care
     provider 114, in near real-time, of any pending mistakes that can lead to
     adverse events, so that they can be avoided or amended altogether.
     Therefore, it is an important tool to be used by care providers for
     mitigating errors in medical administration by instilling corroboration
     and <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B> through the smart medical compliance system
     100a. Color can be displayed on the PDA screen (as well as the text) of
     the item corresponding to a particular tagging of a medical device or
     supply. So, for instance, if a certain medical task calls for a smart
     syringe to connect to a certain piece of medical tubing/coupler, that is
     marked with a red tag on its end, then the word tubing and the color red
     can be displayed on the care provider's PDA display in order to guide the
     care provider in performing the correct operation. Moreover, the PDA's
     auditory alarm can also assist in this process/method as well.
<BR><BR>Universal Smart Key for Medical Applications:
<BR><BR>[0143]The universal smart key illustrated in FIG. 36 contains all the
     necessary features and functionality necessary to perform the operation
     of enabling/opening or closing of a lock that is universal and either
     affixed or incorporated into all of the said smart medical
     devices/apparatuses. This will make the manufacturing of smart medical
     devices much simpler since the only overhead is in the incorporation of a
     mechanical lock to be accessed by an electronic key. The smart medical
     devices themselves, however, will still contain and RFID tag 134 for
     identification and corroboration purposes. It contains an RFID tag 798,
     RFID Reader 794, renewable power source, drive servo/motor, protruding
     mechanical key (which is driven by the servo mechanism), visual and audio
     indicators, status sensors, and a compact housing (or dongle) to be
     attached/detached from a cradle--typically on or near the mobile PDA or
     hand held computer 790. The RFID enabled smart key fits into any and all
     smart medical devices/apparatuses, and can only operate (open, or close)
     the lock of the smart medical device if corroboration occurs. The smart
     key also incorporates an RFID Reader used to determine if the
     identification of the correspondingly "pre-mated" smart medical device is
     indeed the intended one by the operator. In this way, if the smart key is
     presented to the medical device, and corroboration/authentication occurs,
     the knob on the smart key will be free to rotate. Hence, this "permits"
     the lock to open (either manually by the operator, or automatically,
     depending on the embodiment), thereby allowing the operator to gaining
     access to the smart medical device's/apparatus's contents (as in a smart
     medical container), or in another manifestation, allowing the medical
     task (service, procedure, operation) at hand to proceed. It should be
     noted that the "programming" of the smart key is performed by a hand held
     PDA or mobile handheld device 790 with wireless communications and
     operated by the care provider.
<BR><BR>[0144]FIG. 36 is a diagram illustrating a universal smart key and lock
     mechanism. FIG. 36 shows the PDA 790, a wearable holder 788, capable of
     affixing the universal smart key 830 with clip 784. The universal key
     includes a housing 822, RFID reader 794, RFID tag 798, key 806, lock out
     pins 826, power supply 828, audio/visual indicator 818, and servo motor
     802. The lock out pins or similar prevent the key 806 from being inserted
     into the universal locking medical device 814. The universal locking
     medical device 814, is affixed with an RFID 810. The RFID reader 794 is
     capable of reading the RFID 810 of the universal smart lock 814 and
     corroborating this with its RFID 798 and interacting with the PDA 790 to
     confirm that the key is authorized to open the universal smart locking
     medical device 814. Upon authorization, the lock out pins 826 no longer
     prevent the key from accessing the lock. The universal smart key also has
     an optional override knob 832 allowing manual operation.
<BR><BR>Smart Container for Medical Applications
<BR><BR>[0145]The following description is that of an intelligent or
     "Smart"-container (to be used in a method and system) designed for
     improving delivery of medication, medical supplies, or medical
     devices/apparatuses at the patient point of care (including surgery). At
     present a non negligible number of medical incidences (adverse events,
     sentinel events, and near misses) occur comprising of errors and
     accidental and/or incorrect drug administrations to patients as a result
     of ineffective identification and control. The invention described here
     therefore relates to medical reconciliation and compliance at the
     patient/care-provider delivery interface and/or pharmacological
     preparation and dispensing point. The container and its deployment
     address identification and/or control. Identification is accomplished
     with the aid of radio frequency identification (RFID) while the control
     is enabled through a mechanism that can be activated to prevent improper
     access, or facilitate error-free dispensing and/or administration of
     medication and/or medical supply or apparatus. The invention incorporates
     an RFID enabled electromechanical lockable latch enabling the opening
     and/or closing of an access gateway to the content of the container. The
     RFID tag on the container can be either active or passive, and the
     electromechanical latching/locking communication and control can be
     derived from the interaction of the Reader and the RFID tag or associated
     electronics (including RFID System on a chip technology). For example, an
     enable control signal received from the Reader could be used to unlock
     and/or open the container.
<BR><BR>[0146]An instance of the execution of the medical reconciliation and
     compliance platform could entail the following (although not limited to
     following):
<BR><BR>Dispensing of Medical Content: Preparation and Packaging
<BR><BR>[0147]At the pharmacological preparation (dispensing) point, and/or
     central medical supply unit, medical content could be identified and
     placed in an RFID enabled portable or mobile container. The RFID enabled
     container and content could be registered for subsequent tracking: this
     comprises identifying and initializing (locking) the container and/or
     content. At this stage, any mis-packaging can be detected and
     circumvented prior to discharge. The tracking and interoperable
     communication could include suitable encryption methods ensuring reliable
     and confidential delivery and handling of critical data.
<BR><BR>Transport
<BR><BR>[0148]The container (along with medical content) could then be transported
     to the patient point of care (or surgery) via a means consistent with
     conventional medical content distribution. As such, a mobile cart (with
     secure access) is deployed to seamlessly accommodate such RFID enabled
     containers. By the strategically placing of RFID readers along the path
     of transport, time stamp and geographic tracking of entire cart content
     could be established.
<BR><BR>Point of Care medical practice
<BR><BR>[0149]It is envisaged that a point of care provider could have an RFID
     reader and a device (portable wired/wireless hand held computer) capable
     of communicating with the RFID reader and concurrently capable of
     communicating with the main patient data base and medical records of a
     health information system. This communication could be provided through a
     wireless or wired network, intranet, Internet, cellular or telephone
     system. With respect to the hand held computer, the RFID reader could be
     attached, built in, or detached, with wired or wireless communication or
     stand alone capability. Furthermore, the care provider could interrogate
     the RFID tag of the patient (or alternative identification) and
     corroborate this with the RFID tag of the container--containing the
     medical content itself. Upon corroboration (matching the correct identity
     of patient with the medical content) the container could be
     electromechanically unlocked (or unlatched) and the medical content
     retrieved. This process provides information including time-stamp that
     may optionally be logged back to the main patient data base and medical
     records system. It should be noted that the RFID reader can not only read
     the RFID tag of the lockable container but could also interrogate the
     medical content explicitly (whilst encapsulated) if the medical content
     where equipped with an RFID tag.
<BR><BR>Smart Medical Container: Recycling--Disposal, Sterilization, and Reuse:
<BR><BR>[0150]The Smart Medical Container operational components may require
     sterilization for safe reusability. Proper handling and disposal protocol
     (i.e., Bio-hazard compliance) may require that a Disposal Reader log the
     RFID tag of the smart medical container and time-stamp the disposal,
     sending this information back to the main information management or
     records system. Even the reconstitution of the smart medical container
     for re-use may require the time-stamping in its preparation prior to
     redistribution. A secure tamper-proof inlay indicator may be affixed (if
     required) at this point of preparation.
<BR><BR>[0151]As an added feature, the RFID enabled smart container can also be
     used to dispose of any residual, remaining, or expended medical content,
     such as medications (pill, powder, or liquid), medical waste, medical
     supplies, medical devices/apparatuses, or combinations thereof, or
     potential (bio-) hazardous material not necessarily previously RFID
     tagged. In this manner the smart container can be "programmed" or
     initialized to identify content for proper disposal or re-sterilization.
<BR><BR>[0152]The RFID enabled lockable latch container can also be tailored to
     contain medications (pills, powder, or liquid), or other pharmacological
     preparations, and/or other medical supplies, substances, and/or
     apparatuses, thereby making it usable for a wide variety of content. The
     RFID enabled container (or components therein) could also be made
     sterilizable for reusability.
<BR><BR>[0153]Moreover, the RFID enabled container can also be used for inventory
     or storage purposes or for the easy identification of any medical content
     or apparatus.
<BR><BR>[0154]An extension could include a box with a RFID device capable of
     latching the container as well as a RFID Reader integrated on or in the
     container capable of interrogating the contents of the container itself.
     In this manner the RFID tag (and therefore the contents) can be recorded
     when the content is placed in the container and simply be interrogated
     without opening the container.
<BR><BR>[0155]An analogy of the RFID enabled container is similar to any system
     where items are stored in larger containers. These are typical of
     transport and communication systems involving layered architectures. The
     RFID enabled container is capable of providing secure storage for medical
     content, whether the medical content itself is RFID tagged or not. The
     secure storage is provided by way of a lockable mechanism or indicator
     and a means of tracking the container itself with its RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0156]The actual RFID enabled latchable container can manifest itself in a
     variety of forms, such as, although not limited to that of the following:
     a bottle; a two piece separable cavity; or a cylindrical or rectangular
     parallelepiped container. The opening of the container can be at the end,
     or on a side, or in the middle, as in a split two-piece cavity design.
     Other embodiments may include: a 2 piece (split) container design which
     separates (or breaks in two) at a latching/locking point; a "bag" with a
     lockable zipper; and a tear away package (with an RFID security inlay).
     The container can include a clip such that the container can be attached
     to an auxiliary apparatus or belt. The container can also be stackable
     such that many can be easily transported and/or read by a generalized
     RFID reader within an operable time window whilst within the same
     proximity (as in transport, or for inventory purposes).
<BR><BR>[0157]The function of the RFID enabled container device would serve to
     unlock and/or open the container: in one instance, the RFID enabled
     device could supply an indication that the container could be manually
     opened; while in another instance, the RFID would serve to unlock the
     container as well as to open the container itself, thus exposing its
     contents.
<BR><BR>[0158]An instance of a more generalized RFID enabled container could
     include the one or more of the following features, although not limited
     to these: an RFID tag or device for identification of the container, a
     microcontroller/computer with or without auxiliary radio frequency RF
     communication, an electromechanical or mechanical latch, a door or
     shutter that can have a mechanically assisted opening device, a
     disposable or rechargeable detached or attached power source to
     facilitate operation and communication, an RFID reader for content
     interrogation, a Peltier or similar heating or cooling device for
     environmental control, a disposable or sterilizable reusable inner liner
     for securing contents and/or the container itself sterilizable.
<BR><BR>[0159]This portable container could be used for a myriad of applications
     where unlatching the container could be enabled by a limited number of
     persons on an access control list. These applications could include
     firearms, keys, cash, or valuables, etc. The role in the medication
     reconciliation is obvious with the additional benefit that it can be more
     easily integrated into a legacy system.
<BR><BR>[0160]The Smart container could also be equipped with a Biometric user
     identification device ensuring only authorized access to its medical
     contents.
<BR><BR>[0161]A color coded indicator is incorporated into the Smart container
     serving as an indicator for authorized (or unauthorized) access to its
     medical contents. In a manual mechanical operating mode, the latch can be
     opened for egress, or maintained in a locked state. Conversely, in an
     automated operating mode, the latch is electromechanically, or otherwise,
     by mechanical means, opened automatically for egress, or maintained in a
     locked state. For instance, a Red color indicator corresponds to a locked
     latch state, while a Green indicator corresponds to an open latch state,
     denying or allowing access, respectively. Furthermore, an intermediate
     color, such as Yellow, can be used to indicate that medical contents has
     been prepared and sealed in the container--ready for administration.
<BR><BR>[0162]A security "trip-wire" (conductive strip/trace, decal, inlay, or
     pin, security seal) can be incorporated into the smart container affixed
     or attached by adhesive or glue (or other mechanical means) as a
     tamper-proof indicator. A passive or electrically conductive inlay strip
     or decal is placed over the latch/lock or attached to a movable/pivoting
     structure of a smart medical container which provides access (ingress,
     egress) to the gate/door or latch and the associated contents of the
     container. The state of the seal (secured or breached) can be read with
     an RFID Reader.
<BR><BR>Smart Clamp for Medical Applications
<BR><BR>[0163]The following description envelops that of a clamp modified to
     include a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging device and
     interface with bi-directional communication. The design variations
     encompass several pinch-off embodiments but are not exclusive to the
     following forms of screw, cam, scissor, rotational (twist), push-type,
     lever-type, in-line latch, hinge, linear-actuator ram, or roller-actuator
     clamp. The capability therein incorporates an electromechanical
     controller that authorizes the operation of a manual or automatic
     mechanical clamp with lockable-latch and pinch-off mechanism, thereby
     modulating the flow of a powder, liquid, vapor, or gas through a
     collapsible tube or conduit as such. As described, the "smart clamp"
     invention incorporates an RFID tag and accompanying interface (in situ
     and/or external) in a method and system to control the mechanical
     operation of latching and pinching: i) manually enabling or precluding an
     instance of user operation of the pinch mechanism; or ii), automatically
     enabling or precluding an instance of electromechanically energized
     operation of the pinch mechanism. Hence, in addition to facilitating the
     flow by activating the pinch mechanism, this smart clamp assembly, method
     and system, incorporates a lockable latch which will prevent
     unauthorized, erroneous, or inadvertent operation of the clamp.
<BR><BR>[0164]The RFID tag on the smart clamp can be either passive or active with
     an internal and/or external bi-directional electronic communication
     interface to control electromechanical circuitry. The RFID smart clamp
     can be identified with an RFID reader (in the manifestation of a mobile
     or stationary communicating electronic computing device) and used to
     "interrogate" clamp status. The communication and electromechanical
     control can be derived from the interaction of the RFID tag (and
     associated electronics) and the RFID reader--and perhaps an overseeing
     information management system. Upon identification, corroboration, and
     authentication, an "enable" or "disable" control signal received or
     transmitted from the interrogating RFID reader could be used to activate
     or preclude the latch and/or pinch mechanism associated with the RFID
     smart clamp, respectively. The RFID smart clamp can also include
     auxiliary sensor information that can be communicated to the RFID reader
     or vise versa and if necessary up the information management hierarchy
     for re-programming, time stamping, data collection, and/or evaluation.
     This sensor based acquisition can include information such as chemistry,
     temperature, humidity, pressure, flow rate, etc.
<BR><BR>[0165]In effect, the RFID smart clamp assembly, method and system, is
     distinct in that it is used for both identification and as a means of
     control for the enabling or preclusion of flow of a powder, liquid,
     vapor, or gas through a deformable line or channel (conduit, tube, or
     hose). The manual user operated pinch mechanism inherently offers a high
     degree of application flexibility and simplicity in design without
     necessarily compromising functionality. This approach can therefore be
     particularly attractive in many instances since it may well capitalize on
     a concomitant reduction in overhead, ease of fabrication, and increased
     mechanical reliability. On the other hand, offering an automatic RFID
     triggered pinch regulating mechanism offers the potential for ease of
     field deployment and robustness. This implementation incorporates, but is
     not exclusive to those mentioned herein, an electromechanical solenoid,
     servo or motor, pneumatic/hydraulic (possibly Magneto-rheological)
     cylinder or motor, or temperature activated shape memory alloy
     drive--acting upon a screw, cam, ram, pincers, or the like. In
     recognition of these renditions of both manual and automatic pinch
     regulating constricting mechanisms, they yield a myriad of useful clamp
     variants to be used within the context of the RFID smart clamp.
<BR><BR>[0166]One instance of deployment of an RFID smart clamp (used in a medical
     setting) could be to safely gate the release of a fluid as would be the
     case for Intravenous (IV) or Infusion Therapy. In another instance of
     deployment, the RFID smart clamp is applicable to the handling or
     management of industrial chemicals. In general, these include volatile
     and/or hazardous powders, liquids, vapors, and gases. Where regulation
     and safety standards necessitate proper handling and mixing protocols, as
     such, the RFID smart clamp could be used in various medical, industrial,
     commercial, or residential applications.
<BR><BR>[0167]There are several in-field embodiments of design pertaining to the
     definitive actuation or modulation (or lack thereof of an RFID smart
     clamp pinch mechanism: in one mechanical instance of operation, the RFID
     smart clamp would simply provide a visual or audio status indicator
     approving/disapproving the manual operation (open or close) of the clamp
     pinch mechanism; in another mechanical instance of operation, the RFID
     smart clamp could physically unlock a latch mechanism that would permit
     the manual operation (open or close) of the clamp mechanism; finally, in
     an electromechanical instance of operation, the RFID smart clamp could
     physically unlock a latch mechanism and provide the actual electromotive
     means that would automatically modulate (open or close, potentially with
     cam or ram specified variations therein) the clamp pinch mechanism.
<BR><BR>[0168]The actual RFID smart clamp physical deployment can manifest itself
     in a variety of forms, although not limited to the following: a clamp
     that is in effect "clamped" or fastened over a deformable line or channel
     (conduit, tube, or hose); or, a clamp whereby the deformable line or
     channel (conduit, tube, or hose) is inserted through the apparatus
     itself. As such, these basic variations include clam-shell and in-line
     versions, respectively.
<BR><BR>[0169]The primary function of the RFID smart clamp would serve to restrict
     the flow of a powder, liquid, vapor, or gas through a deformable channel.
     However, in the field, under temporal command and control, an RFID smart
     clamp would provide for the means of identification of the clamp itself,
     an indication of the actual state of restriction--or variations thereof,
     and the intended position or state of the pinch mechanism (opened or
     closed) to be either manually or automatically accommodated. With an
     automatic capability, the RFID smart clamp would "automatically" serve to
     pinch the tube itself by way of an electromotive mechanism, thus allowing
     or restricting the flow of a powder, liquid, vapor, or gas through a
     deformable channel.
<BR><BR>[0170]In general the RFID smart clamp could include one or more of the
     following features, although not limited to these: an RFID tag or device
     for identification of the smart clamp; a microcontroller/computer with or
     without auxiliary radio frequency (RF) communication; an
     electromechanical or mechanical flow constricting (limiting) mechanism;
     and/or, a disposable or rechargeable detached or attached power source to
     facilitate operation and communication in the event the power were not
     provided by the RFID interrogator. Instances of these components and
     others are illustrated in several smart clamp variants in the attached
     drawings.
<BR><BR>[0171]The RFID smart clamp could be used for a myriad of applications
     where restricting of a flow would be useful. The smart clamp could also
     be enabled by a limited number of persons on an access control list
     preventing inadvertent or malicious operation of the clamp by
     unauthorized personnel. This access control list would be moderated,
     controlled, and maintained by an overseeing information management
     system.
<BR><BR>[0172]In the event of device failure or tampering, the smart clamp will
     recognize the state or instance of anomaly using onboard sensors and
     logic and initiate a failsafe protocol to circumvent dangerous
     administration or utilization.
<BR><BR>[0173]It is envisaged that the clamp operator at the point of actuation
     would have an RFID reader with a personal digital assistant (PDA) or
     other portable or mobile wired/wireless hand held computer (integrated or
     stand alone) capable of communicating with the smart clamp and
     concurrently capable of communicating with the main plant information
     management system. This later communication could be provided through a
     wireless or wired network, intranet, Internet, cellular or telephone
     system. As previously mentioned, with respect to the hand held computer,
     the RFID reader could be attached, built in, or detachable, with wired or
     wireless communication or stand alone capability. The protocol of
     operation calls for the clamp operator to interrogate the RFID tag or
     smart clamp and upon corroboration (matching the correct identity of the
     clamp with the desired actuation state) the smart clamp could be
     electromechanically unlocked (or unlatched) and the pinch mechanism
     enabled or prepared for actuation. If the smart clamp is manual in nature
     (mechanical instance) it is left to the operator to perform the actual
     pinch-off function using the built in or keyed manual actuator. On the
     other hand, if the smart clamp is automatic in nature (electromechanical
     instance) the actual pinch-off function is performed automatically
     without operator intervention or assistance. The process described above
     can also provide services including time-stamps, data collection, and
     sensor information that may optionally be logged back to the main plant
     records system.
<BR><BR>[0174]A failsafe protocol can also be affected within the scope of the
     present method and system. In the event of smart clamp device failure,
     the operator has prior knowledge and procedures for overriding the
     malfunctioning smart clamp without compromising intended purpose,
     operation, and functionality. The smart clamp performs self test
     diagnostics periodically, upon power up, or query. In this manner, any
     anomaly will be reported to the operator for override, repair, or
     intervention. The onboard intelligence of the smart clamp itself will
     provide an audio or visual warning, or through wireless communication,
     provide a warning to the hand held computer notifying the operator of a
     hardware failure. The operator may now invoke an override procedure to
     manually bypass the failure and continue with intended clamp function in
     compliance with failsafe protocol. The overall operation is not
     compromised since the failure mode has been recognized and recorded, thus
     allowing steps to be undertaken to repair or replace the defective smart
     clamp. This process is overseen by the information management and
     compliance system to conform to standards for minimizing the presence of
     a defective smart clamp in the field. The compliance conforms to
     requirements within each field of application and deployment. The purpose
     is to safeguard against erroneous, unauthorized, malicious, or accidental
     use, and moderate the handling or management of defective or obsolete
     devices. The actual override procedure is performed by an authorized
     operator utilizing a manual actuator or override key. This operation is
     also monitored and recorded by the smart clamp and communicated via the
     handheld computer to the information management and compliance system.
<BR><BR>[0175]Other types of failure modes would be handled in a similar fashion
     under the guidance and instruction from the information management and
     compliance system.
<BR><BR>[0176]The Smart Clamp operational components may require sterilization for
     safe reusability. Proper handling and disposal protocol (i.e., Bio-hazard
     compliance) may require that a Disposal Reader log the RFID tag of the
     smart clamp and time-stamp the disposal, sending this information back to
     the main information management or records system. Even the
     reconstitution of the smart clamp for re-use may require the
     time-stamping in its preparation prior to redistribution. A secure
     tamper-proof inlay indicator may be affixed (if required) at this point
     of preparation.
<BR><BR>[0177]The attached figures illustrate various instances of the smart clamp
     and modes of operation. The drawings encompass several pinch-off
     embodiments: screw-type (drawings 2 and 3); cam-type (drawings 4 and 5);
     scissor-type (drawing 6); rotational-type (drawing 7 and 8); push-type
     (drawing 9); lever-type (drawing 10); in-line latch-type (drawing 11);
     hinge-type (drawing 12); linear-actuator ram-type (drawings 13 and 14);
     and, roller-actuator-type (drawings 15 and 16).
<BR><BR>[0178]These smart clamps all contain lockable-latch mechanisms (but could
     simply contain an insecure latch) with pinch-off mechanisms that are
     either manual (drawings 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15) or
     automatic (drawings 3, 5, 8, 14, and 16) in function. As illustrated, the
     instances of manual smart clamps have manually operated actuators which
     serve to activate the pinch-off mechanism. Contrastively, the automatic
     smart clamps have an automatic (electromechanical) pinch-off mechanism to
     serve the same functionality.

<BR><BR>Smart Valve for Medical Applications
<BR><BR>[0194]A "conventional" valve is a manual or automatic (power assisted)
     mechanical device used to control the direction, volume, rate, and/or
     pressure of flow of a liquid, vapor, gas, slurry, or dry material
     (powder), through a passageway such as a line, channel, conduit,
     pipeline, hose, or chute.
<BR><BR>[0195]The following "Smart Valve" description envelops this basic valve
     principle however offers much greater capability and purpose by including
     a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging device and interface with
     bi-directional communication. The smart valve design variations encompass
     several flow constriction (regulation) and housing embodiments. The
     capability therein incorporates a controller that authorizes the
     operation of a manual or automatic mechanical valve with lockable-latch
     and pinch-off regulating mechanism, thereby modulating the flow of a,
     liquid, vapor, gas, slurry, or dry material (powder), through a channel,
     conduit, pipeline, hose, or chute, as such. As described, the smart valve
     invention incorporates an RFID tag and accompanying interface (in situ
     and/or external) in a method and system to control the mechanical
     operation of a valve: i) manually enabling or precluding an instance of
     user operation of the valve regulating mechanism; or ii), automatically
     enabling or precluding an instance of power assisted (e.g.,
     electromechanically) or energized operation of the valve regulating
     mechanism. Hence, in addition to facilitating the flow by activating the
     valve regulating mechanism (opening, closing, or modulating), this smart
     valve assembly, method and system, incorporates a lockable-latch which
     will prevent unauthorized, erroneous, or inadvertent operation of the
     valve. In the field, information will be available as to the status of
     operation (metrics, performance), maintenance, and serviceability.
<BR><BR>[0196]The RFID tag on the smart valve can be either passive or active with
     an internal and/or external bi-directional electronic communication and
     microcomputer interface to control electromechanical circuitry. The RFID
     smart valve can be identified with an RFID reader (in the manifestation
     of a mobile or stationary communicating electronic computing device) and
     used to "interrogate" valve status. The communication and
     electromechanical control can be derived from the interaction of the RFID
     tag (and associated electronics) and the RFID reader--and, in some
     instances, an overseeing information management system. Upon
     identification, corroboration, and authentication, an "enable" or
     "disable" control signal received or transmitted from the interrogating
     RFID reader could be used to activate or preclude the latch and/or
     pinch-off regulating mechanism associated with the smart valve,
     respectively. The smart valve can also include auxiliary sensor
     information and memory that can be communicated to the RFID reader or
     vise versa, and if necessary, up the information management hierarchy for
     re-programming, time stamping, data collection, and/or (re)-evaluation.
     This sensor based acquisition can include information such as
     temperature, pressure, flow rate, viscosity, humidity, chemistry, Ph,
     etc.
<BR><BR>[0197]In effect, the smart valve assembly, method and system, is distinct
     in that it is used for both identification and as a means of control for
     the enabling or preclusion of flow of a liquid, vapor, gas, slurry, or
     dry material (powder) through a passageway. The manual user operated
     valve pinch-off regulation mechanism inherently offers a high degree of
     application flexibility and simplicity in design without necessarily
     compromising functionality. This approach can therefore be particularly
     attractive in many instances since it may well capitalize on a
     concomitant reduction in overhead, ease of fabrication, and increased
     mechanical reliability. On the other hand, offering an automatic RFID
     triggered valve pinch-off regulating mechanism offers the potential for
     ease of field deployment and robustness. This implementation incorporates
     (but is not exclusive to those mentioned herein) an electromechanical
     solenoid, servo or motor, pneumatic/hydraulic (possibly
     Magneto-rheological) cylinder or motor, or temperature activated shape
     memory alloy drive--acting upon a shaft (screw) fixed to a plunger in the
     form of a gate, flap, rod, cylinder, ball, or acting upon a diaphragm,
     collapsible tubing, or the like, in a sealed housing or chamber. In
     recognition of these renditions (of both manual and automatic valve
     regulating constricting mechanisms), they yield a myriad of useful valve
     variants to be used within the context of the RFID enabled smart valve.
<BR><BR>[0198]One instance of deployment of a smart valve (used in a medical
     setting) could be to safely gate the release of a fluid as would be the
     case for Intravenous (IV) or Infusion Therapy. In another instance of
     deployment, the smart valve can be used in handling, preparation, or
     management, of pharmaceuticals or industrial chemicals. In general, these
     substances include precious, volatile, and/or hazardous liquids, vapors,
     gases, slurries, and dry materials (powders). Where regulation and safety
     standards necessitate proper handling and mixing protocols, as such, the
     smart valve could be used in various medical, industrial, commercial, and
     residential/domestic settings.
<BR><BR>[0199]There are several in-field embodiments of design pertaining to the
     definitive actuation or modulation (or lack thereof of a smart valve
     pinch regulating mechanism: in one mechanical instance of operation, the
     smart valve would simply provide a visual or audio status indicator
     approving/disapproving the manual operation (opening, closing,
     modulating) of the valve regulating mechanism; in another mechanical
     instance of operation, the smart valve could physically unlock a latch
     mechanism that would permit the manual operation (opening, closing,
     modulating) of the valve regulating mechanism; finally, in an
     electromechanical instance of operation, the smart valve could physically
     unlock a latch mechanism and provide the actual power assisted means
     (e.g., electromotive force) that would automatically modulate (drive) the
     valve regulating mechanism (plunger) such as a gate, flap, rod, cylinder,
     or ball.
<BR><BR>[0200]Most Smart valve-types can be divided into three general groups
     which similarly reflect the more conventional valve-type classifications:
     Stop valves; Check valves; and, Specialty valves. What they all have in
     common is a mechanism for gating flow--either with on-off or throttling
     operation. Stop valves are used to regulate, or in some instances, block
     or shut-off the flow entirely, whereas Check valves are designed to
     permit variable flow, albeit only in one predetermined direction at a
     time. Specialty valves are designated for those applications which
     require special purpose functionality, specification, or standards. In
     this case, they may necessitate special material requirements (for
     pressure, temperature, corrosion or erosion resistance), maintenance and
     repair requirements, actuation requirements, and operations requirements.
<BR><BR>[0201]There are several classifications under the most common of the
     general smart valve-type categories: Multi-turn or Linear-motion valves;
     Quarter-turn or Rotary valves; Self-actuated valves; Control valves; and,
     Specialty valves. Multi-turn or Linear-motion valves consist of Gate,
     Globe, Pinch, Diaphragm, and Needle valves; Quarter-turn or Rotary valves
     consist of Plug, Ball, and Butterfly valves; Self-actuated valves consist
     of Check/Stop and Pressure Relief valves; Control valves consist of those
     which generally operate with a high degree of precision, action and
     reaction time; and, Specialty valves (as described above) consist of
     those which require special purpose operational and deployment
     considerations.
<BR><BR>[0202]In general a control valve is designed to ensure the accurate
     proportioning or control of flow. It automatically varies the rate of
     flow based on signals it receives from sensing devices in a continuous
     process. Some valves are designed specifically as control valves.
     However, most types of valves can be converted to control valves (either
     with linear or rotary motion depending on the type of valve to be
     exploited) by the addition of power actuators, positioners, and/or other
     accessories or sensors. In this manner, the RFID enabled smart valves
     disclosed here can also be extended to enhance its capabilities in a
     similar fashion.
<BR><BR>[0203]Within the broad range of smart valve-types are those whose
     identifying difference is in their actual method of actuation. These
     methods of actuation also determine several smart valve-type
     manifestations: Mechanical valves, using wheels, gears, levers, pulleys,
     linkages, springs, threaded shafts, and the like; Solenoid valves, which
     include Electromechanical, Pneumatic, or Hydraulic actuators; and,
     Electronic or Electric valves, which activate according to digital
     electronics or electrical circuits for high precision and fast reaction
     time.
<BR><BR>[0204]Several smart valve-type incarnations may incorporate the
     hybridization of different technologies to be engineered (for automatic
     or reactive control of flow)--serving to respond to different
     environmental or conditional variants. Such variants may include
     temperature, pressure, flow rate, viscosity, humidity, chemistry, Ph,
     etc., or any combination thereof.
<BR><BR>[0205]Wherever or whenever a means of actuation is required to facilitate
     a valve flow regulating "drive" mechanism (in machine coupled operation)
     manual or automatic actuators can be deployed. Manual actuation employs
     shafts, levers, wheels, and gears, for hand methods of operation to
     facilitate movement, while automatic actuation is ideal for those
     applications requiring remote operation and/or larger horse power (or
     torque) demands. For this reason, a separate external power source is
     required. For instance, this may include electromechanical drives or
     motors powered by electricity, and/or hydraulic or pneumatic drives
     powered by gas (air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide, etc.) or fluid (oil,
     etc.) pressure.
<BR><BR>[0206]The actual smart valve physical deployment can manifest itself in a
     variety of ways--although not limited to the following: a valve (variable
     clamp) that is in effect "clamped" or fastened over a deformable
     passageway such as a line, channel, conduit, pipeline, hose, or chute; a
     valve (variable clamp) whereby a deformable passageway such as a line,
     channel, conduit, pipeline, hose, or chute, is inserted through the
     apparatus itself; or, a valve whose entry/evacuation ports are fastened
     to in-line breakaway passageways such as a lines, channels, conduits,
     pipelines, hoses, or even chutes.
<BR><BR>[0207]The primary function of the smart valve would serve to enable or
     preclude the flow of a liquid, vapor, gas, slurry, or dry material
     (powder) through a passageway. However, in the field, under temporal
     command and control, a smart valve would provide for the means of
     identification of the valve itself, an indication of the actual state of
     constriction--or variations thereof, and the intended position or state
     of the valve regulating mechanism (opened, closed, or modulated variation
     therein) to be either manually or automatically accommodated. With an
     automatic capability, the smart valve would "automatically" serve to
     modulate the flow by way of a powered/energized valve regulating
     mechanism or actuator, thus controlling the direction, rate, volume,
     and/or pressure, of flow through a passageway.
<BR><BR>[0208]In general the smart valve could include one or more of the
     following features, although not limited to these: an RFID tag or device
     for the identification of the smart valve; a microcontroller/computer
     with or without auxiliary radio frequency (RF) communication; an
     electromechanical or mechanical flow constricting (limiting) mechanism;
     and/or, a disposable or rechargeable detached or attached power source to
     facilitate operation and communication in the event the power were not
     provided by the RFID interrogator. Instances of these components and
     others are illustrated in several smart valve variants in the attached
     drawings.
<BR><BR>[0209]The smart valve could be used for a myriad of applications where
     controlling a flow would be useful. The smart valve could also be enabled
     by a limited number of persons on an access control list preventing
     inadvertent, erroneous, or malicious operation of the valve by
     unauthorized personnel. This access control list would be moderated,
     controlled, and maintained by an overseeing information management and
     records system.
<BR><BR>[0210]In the event of device failure or tampering, the smart valve will
     recognize the state or instance of anomaly using onboard sensors and
     logic and initiate a failsafe protocol to circumvent dangerous
     administration or utilization.
<BR><BR>[0211]It is envisaged that the valve operator at the point of
     dissemination would have an RFID reader with a personal digital assistant
     (PDA) or other portable or mobile wired/wireless hand held computer
     (integrated or stand alone) capable of communicating with the smart valve
     and concurrently capable of communicating with the main plant information
     management or records system. This later communication could be provided
     through a wireless or wired network, intranet, Internet, cellular or
     telephone system. As previously mentioned, with respect to the hand held
     computer, the RFID reader could be attached, built in, or detachable,
     with wired or wireless communication or stand alone capability.
<BR><BR>[0212]The protocol of operation calls for the valve operator to
     interrogate the RFID tag or smart valve, and upon corroboration (matching
     the correct identity of the valve with the desired actuation state) the
     smart valve could be electromechanically unlocked (or unlatched) and the
     valve mechanism enabled or prepared for actuation. (The process of
     authentication can include a biometric interface to further corroborate
     operator access, permissions, and authority.)
<BR><BR>[0213]If the smart valve is manual in nature (mechanical instance) it is
     left to the operator to perform the actual valve function using the built
     in or keyed manual actuator. On the other hand, if the smart valve is
     automatic in nature (electromechanical instance) the actual valve
     function is performed automatically without operator intervention or
     assistance. The process described above can also provide services
     including time-stamps, sensor information acquisition, and operational
     data collection--that may optionally be logged back to the main plant
     information management records system.
<BR><BR>[0214]A failsafe protocol can also be affected within the scope of the
     present method and system. In the event of smart valve device failure,
     the operator has prior knowledge and procedures for overriding the
     malfunctioning smart valve without compromising intended purpose,
     operation, and functionality. The smart valve performs self test
     diagnostics periodically, upon power up, or query. In this manner, any
     anomaly will be reported to the operator for override, repair, or
     intervention. The onboard intelligence of the smart valve itself will
     provide an audio or visual warning, or through wireless communication,
     provide a warning to the hand held computer notifying the operator of a
     hardware failure. The operator may now invoke an override procedure to
     manually bypass the failure and continue with intended valve function in
     compliance with failsafe protocol. The overall operation is not
     compromised since the failure mode has been recognized and recorded, thus
     allowing steps to be undertaken to repair or replace the defective smart
     valve. This process is overseen by the information management and
     compliance system to conform to standards for minimizing the presence of
     a defective smart valve in the field. The compliance conforms to
     requirements within each field of application and deployment. The purpose
     is to safeguard against erroneous, unauthorized, malicious, or
     inadvertent (accidental) use, and moderate the handling, management, or
     replacement, of defective or obsolete devices. The actual override
     procedure is performed by an "authorized operator" utilizing a manual
     actuator or override key. The override key could be equipped with
     sufficient electronics (RFID tag with microelectronic interface, position
     Resolver, visual and/or audible indicator, and power supply) along with a
     physical interface to obtain position or state information (status) from
     the defective smart valve. Moreover, the key should be capable of setting
     or resetting the defective smart valve to a new state or operational
     position. The information gathered from the override key would be
     accessible via a read operation performed on the override key by an
     interrogating reader. This operation could also be monitored and recorded
     by the smart valve depending on its still remaining functional
     capabilities. All available information gathered via the handheld
     computer can be communicated to the information management and compliance
     system for real time feedback/notification and/or post incident
     investigation and analysis.
<BR><BR>[0215]The overall process of recording these (and previously described)
     operations is analogous to the data logging employed in the aviation
     industry utilizing a "Black Box." Other types of failure modes can be
     handled in a similar fashion under the guidance and instruction from the
     information management and compliance system. Such transactions (device
     status, time stamps, authorization, operations, etc.) and data storage
     can be made cryptographically secure preventing alteration or
     modification.
<BR><BR>[0216]The Smart Valve operational components may require sterilization for
     safe reusability. Proper handling and disposal protocol (i.e., Bio-hazard
     compliance) may require that a Disposal Reader log the RFID tag of the
     smart valve and time-stamp the disposal, sending this information back to
     the main information management or records system. Even the
     reconstitution of the smart valve for re-use may require the
     time-stamping in its preparation prior to redistribution. A secure
     tamper-proof inlay indicator may be affixed (if required) at this point
     of preparation.
<BR><BR>[0217]The attached drawings illustrate various instances of the smart
     valve and modes of operation. The drawings encompass several valve
     pinch-off regulating mechanisms and housing embodiments: multi-port
     stop-cock or cylinder-type (drawings 17 and 18) with 2 and 3 ports, and
     their corresponding flow channels (drawings 19 and 20), respectively,
     with a rotational shaft; butterfly-type, with a rotational shaft (drawing
     21); and, gate, globe, or needle-type, with a screw shaft (drawings 22
     and 23).
<BR><BR>[0218]These smart valves contain lockable-latch mechanisms (but could
     simply contain an insecure latch) with valve regulating mechanisms that
     are either manual or automatic in function. As illustrated, the instances
     of manual smart valves have manually operated actuators which serve to
     activate the valve pinch-off regulating mechanism. On the other hand, the
     automatic smart valves have an automatic (electromechanical) valve
     pinch-off regulating mechanism to serve the same functionality.
<BR><BR>[0219]In the series of Figures numbered 17, 18, 21, and 23, there is
     illustrated RFID enabled smart valves with electromotive actuators. An
     electromotive actuator has an electric motor drive that provides torque
     to operate a valve pinch-off regulating mechanism. These actuators are
     frequently used on multi-turn valves such as gate or globe valves. With
     the addition of a gearbox, they can be utilized on plug, butterfly, or
     other quarter-turn valves. Other automatic actuators considered for use
     in the smart valve engineering can include those based on other
     propulsion forces such as hydraulic, pneumatic, and temperature activated
     shape memory alloys.
<BR><BR>[0220]In the series of Figures numbered 17 and 18 there is illustrated
     smart stop-cock valves employing a cylindrical valve regulating control
     mechanism in multi-port configurations. The cylindrical plunger and
     housing accommodate a rotating cavity that allows for flow pathways in a
     variety of channel combinations. Such smart stop-cock valves offer a wide
     range of flexibility in that several port and throughway combinations are
     available in a compact package. For example, in FIG. 17, the open
     actuator position allows for a straight-through flow pathway, but shuts
     off flow when the cylinder is rotated 90 degrees to block the flow
     passage. This configuration is commonly used for on/off and throttling
     services. In FIG. 18, one can deduce that there are a host of flow
     pathway combinations to be had depending on the angular position of the
     shaft relative to the valve housing. A cylindrical plunger with a
     branching cavity hollow juxtaposes with the housing embodiment of the
     valve in a variety of positions--yielding variety of flow pathways.
<BR><BR>[0221]In addition to the stop-cock type smart valves shown, FIGS. 21, 22,
     and 23, indicate other straight-through type smart valve embodiments in
     the form of butterfly, gate, globe, pinch, or needle type plunger
     configurations. Hence it is safe to say that many purposeful RFID enabled
     smart valves can be derived from virtually any base valve-types in
     addition to those which have been described in the document.
<BR><BR>[0222]In the series of Figures numbered 17 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart stop-cock valve (electromechanical instance; mechanical instance
     similar illustration). FIG. 17A shows the conduit 488, RFID 212, enabled
     lock/unlock mechanism 326, electronics 204, override key 492, power
     supply 266 and electromechanical cylinder rotary valve 484. An
     electromechanical motor/servo adjusts a valve thus unrestricting or
     restricting the flow in the conduit 488 when the RFID enabled lock
     mechanism 326 is unlocked. FIG. 17B shows a top view of the valve in the
     state of restricted flow.
<BR><BR>[0223]In the series of Figures numbered 18 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart multi-port stop-cock valve (electromechanical instance; mechanical
     instance similar illustration). FIG. 18A shows the conduit 488, RFID 212,
     enabled lock/unlock mechanism 326, electronics 204, override key 492,
     power supply 266 and electromechanical cylinder rotary valve 496. An
     electromechanical motor/servo adjusts a valve thus unrestricting or
     restricting the flow in the conduit 488 when the RFID enabled lock
     mechanism 326 is unlocked. FIG. 18B shows a top view of the valve
     illustrating the multiple ports.
<BR><BR>[0224]In the series of Figures numbered 19 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart stop-cock valve. FIG. 19A shows the conduit 488, housing 500, and
     alignment markers indicating the position of the valve being in an
     unrestricted flow state. FIG. 17B shows the conduit 488, housing 500, and
     alignment markers indicating the position of the valve being in a flow
     restricting state.
<BR><BR>[0225]In the series of Figures numbered 20 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart 3 port 4 way stop-cock valve. FIG. 20A shows the conduit 488,
     housing 500, and alignment markers indicating the position of the valve
     being in an unrestricted flow state for all 3 ports. FIG. 20B shows the
     conduit 488, housing 500, and alignment markers indicating the position
     of the valve being in a straight through flow state. FIG. 20C shows the
     conduit 488, housing 500, and alignment markers indicating the position
     of the valve allowing flow through the lower two conduits. FIG. 20D shows
     the conduit 488, housing 500, and alignment markers indicating the
     position of the valve allowing flow through the top two conduits. As
     noted the valve can also be positioned to prevent flow in all 3 conduits.
<BR><BR>[0226]In the series of Figures numbered 21 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart butterfly valve (mechanical 508 and electromechanical instance
     528). FIG. 21A shows the housing 524, RFID 212, status indicator 520,
     optional lock/unlock mechanism 326, a lever 512 affecting the butterfly
     516 valve. FIG. 21B shows the housing 524, RFID 212, status indicator
     520, lock/unlock mechanism 326, power supply 266, electric motor 536
     affecting the butterfly 516 valve, and an override key 532. FIGS. 21C,
     21D, and 21E, illustrates side views of the butterfly valve in the
     closed, partially closed, and open states.
<BR><BR>[0227]In the series of Figures numbered 22 is a diagram illustrating smart
     [Gate, Globe, Needle] valve (adjustable screw mechanical instance).
     Illustrated is the conduit 488, housing 540, RFID 212, optional
     lock/unlock mechanism 326, visual/audio indicator 208, optional power
     supply 238, associated electronics 204, and a manual screw actuator 544.
     When the RFID 212 enables the indicator 208 or lock mechanism 326 the
     manual screw actuator 544 can be used to restrict or open the flow.
<BR><BR>[0228]In the series of Figures numbered 23 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart [Gate, Globe, Needle] valve (adjustable screw electromechanical
     instance). Illustrated is the conduit 488, housing 548, RFID 212,

     204, power supply 266, and an electromechanical pinch-off screw actuator
     522. When the RFID 212 enables the indicator 208 and lock mechanism 326
     the electromechanical pinch-off screw actuator 552 can be used to
     restrict or open the flow. An override key is shown as 556.
<BR><BR>Smart Syringe for Medical Applications
<BR><BR>[0229]A "conventional" syringe is a manual or automatic (power assisted)
     injection-mechanical device used to transfer a fluid preparation or
     therapy (liquid or gas) from a reservoir through a discharge channel via
     a nozzle in a controlled and accurate manner. Some of the fluid discharge
     or transfer control variables include the direction, volume, rate, and/or
     pressure of flow.
<BR><BR>[0230]The following "Smart Syringe" description envelopes this basic
     syringe principal however offers much greater capability and purpose by
     including a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging device and
     interface with bi-directional communication. The invention itself has a
     provision for discharge (or a means of fluid transfer), and hence
     delivery, through a nozzle and channel (coupler and/or tubing) and/or a
     hollow needle accessory or attachment for penetration directly into a
     host or an Intravenous set Y-connector or the like. Its purpose is for
     improving the preparation, transport, delivery, administration, and
     disposal (e.g., for enhanced patient safety and quality of care) of an
     injectable or oral fluid preparation or therapy (including chemical,
     medication, drug, infusion fluid, vaccine, serum, or vitamin).
<BR><BR>[0231]For the purpose of demonstrating the invention of a Smart Syringe,
     the emphasis (as depicted here) is on a medical setting and application
     environment. This serves to demonstrate the design, operation, and
     functionality of a Smart Syringe, however, it is understood that it can
     be successfully applied to other application areas including industrial
     and commercial usage along these lines.
<BR><BR>[0232]The RFID device of the syringe can be either passive or active. It
     has to have the added capability of setting or releasing the latch
     mechanism of the syringe. It is the RFID or an interfaced or integrated
     module with associated electronics that enables or disables the
     latch/lock upon confirmation between the RFID of the smart syringe
     (prescription), care provider, patient, and perhaps knowledge from an
     overseeing information management system. The power for the module (if
     required) could come from the RFID device directly or from its own
     on-board power supply.
<BR><BR>[0233]The smart syringe with its RFID enable mechanism would encompass one
     or more of the following items: a status indicator; a shut-off mechanism
     or latch/lock that would be included--capable of being activated or
     de-activated by the care provider upon correct correspondence between the
     RFID tags of the smart syringe, patient, and care provider; a mechanism
     for depressing/expanding the syringe plunger--allowing manual care
     provider mode of operation; an electromechanical actuator for the
     automatic injection or depression/expansion of the syringe plunger using
     a motor or servo or the like--allowing automatic care provider mode of
     operation; a mechanism that detects plunger position--recording the
     amount of fluid dispensed--to be interrogated by the RFID reader/mobile
     or portable computing device. (This could incorporate a "resolver" such
     as a diffraction grating/Light Emitting Diode and photo-detector
     combination, linear-variable potentiometer, gear-transmission based
     rotary-variable potentiometer, etc.)
<BR><BR>[0234]It should be noted that in a physical realization instance, the
     latch/lock device itself could also be an adaptor retrofitted to existing
     syringes as a collar device that could also be reusable and even
     re-sterilizable. This device would again contain an RFID tag for
     identification as well as control (including actuation). The lock or
     latch mechanism would securely grip the syringe plunger preventing
     administration of contents until its RFID was read and corroborated with
     the care provider, patient--at which point the release mechanism would be
     enabled thereby freeing the plunger to allow authorized administration
     the fluid.
<BR><BR>[0235]It should be noted that in some instances such as
     administering/injecting a medication through a smart syringe (within the
     near field of the RFID Reader 116), several RFID tags may have to read at
     the same time in order for the syringe latch or valve to allow for the
     flow of medication contained in the syringe into the intravenous (IV)
     set. In this case, say a Y connector (with accompanying injection site),
     or some other place or point of ingress within the channel, it could have
     an RFID tag affixed to it to be read at the same time as the smart
     syringe RFID tag. By the correct positioning of the handheld RFID Reader
     (in order to corroborate the compliance and warrant the opening of the
     latch or valve on the syringe), the medication can be permitted to flow
     through/into the Y-connector of the Intravenous set, and on into the
     patient.
<BR><BR>[0236]If the amount of dispensed quantity actually differs from that of
     the quantity specified by the overseeing physician or clinician, the
     shut-off device could be activated to cut off the fluid flow or supply,
     respectively. Contrastively, this mechanism can also be adapted to
     dispense the correct amount of injectable fluid.
<BR><BR>[0237]Upon dispensing of the drug from the syringe, the smart syringe RFID
     would again be read at disposal. More specifically, when the syringe is
     disposed of after use it is typically disposed of securely. An RFID
     reader located on a disposal chute would read the RFID, time-stamp the
     event, and provide this information back to a central main patient data
     base and records system. The timestamp information can also be used to
     close the loop on when, where, to whom, by whom, and what fluid was
     administered. It is apparent that the reading of the smart syringe ID is
     useful even if the syringe RFID device is only used for identification.
<BR><BR>[0238]It is envisaged that the clamp operator at the point of actuation
     would have an RFID reader with a personal digital assistant (PDA) or
     other portable or mobile wired/wireless hand held computer (integrated or
     stand alone) capable of communicating with the smart clamp and
     concurrently capable of communicating with the main plant information
     management system. This later communication could be provided through a
     wireless or wired network, intranet, Internet, cellular or telephone
     system. As previously mentioned, with respect to the hand held computer,
     the RFID reader could be attached, built in, or detachable, with wired or
     wireless communication or stand alone capability. The protocol of
     operation calls for the clamp operator to interrogate the RFID tag or
     smart clamp and upon corroboration (matching the correct identity of the
     clamp with the desired actuation state) the smart clamp could be
     electromechanically unlocked (or unlatched) and the pinch mechanism
     enabled or prepared for actuation. If the smart clamp is manual in nature
     (mechanical instance) it is left to the operator to perform the actual
     pinch-off function using the built in or keyed manual actuator. On the
     other hand, if the smart clamp is automatic in nature (electromechanical
     instance) the actual pinch-off function is performed automatically
     without operator intervention or assistance. The process described above
     can also provide services including time-stamps, data collection, and
     sensor information that may optionally be logged back to the main plant
     records system.
<BR><BR>[0239]A failsafe protocol can also be affected within the scope of the
     present method and system. In the event of smart clamp device failure,
     the operator has prior knowledge and procedures for overriding the
     malfunctioning smart clamp without compromising intended purpose,
     operation, and functionality. The smart clamp performs self test
     diagnostics periodically, upon power up, or query. In this manner, any
     anomaly will be reported to the operator for override, repair, or
     intervention. The onboard intelligence of the smart clamp itself will
     provide an audio or visual warning, or through wireless communication,
     provide a warning to the hand held computer notifying the operator of a
     hardware failure. The operator may now invoke an override procedure to
     manually bypass the failure and continue with intended clamp function in
     compliance with failsafe protocol. The overall operation is not
     compromised since the failure mode has been recognized and recorded, thus
     allowing steps to be undertaken to repair or replace the defective smart
     clamp. This process is overseen by the information management and
     compliance system to conform to standards for minimizing the presence of
     a defective smart clamp in the field. The compliance conforms to
     requirements within each field of application and deployment. The purpose
     is to safeguard against erroneous, unauthorized, malicious, or accidental
     use, and moderate the handling or management of defective or obsolete
     devices. The actual override procedure is performed by an authorized
     operator utilizing a manual actuator or override key. This operation is
     also monitored and recorded by the smart clamp and communicated via the
     handheld computer to the information management and compliance system.
<BR><BR>[0240]Other types of failure modes would be handled in a similar fashion
     under the guidance and instruction from the information management and
     compliance system.
<BR><BR>[0241]The Smart Syringe operational components may require sterilization
     for safe reusability. Proper handling and disposal protocol (i.e.,
     Bio-hazard compliance) may require that a Disposal Reader log the RFID
     tag of the smart syringe and time-stamp the disposal, sending this
     information back to the main information management or records system.
     Even the reconstitution of the smart syringe for re-use may require the
     time-stamping in its preparation prior to redistribution. A secure
     tamper-proof inlay indicator may be affixed (if required) at this point
     of preparation.
<BR><BR>[0242]The attached drawings illustrate various instances of the smart
     syringe and modes of operation. The drawings encompass several
     syringe/plunger regulating mechanisms and housing embodiments.
<BR><BR>[0243]These smart syringes contain lockable-latch mechanisms (but could
     simply contain an insecure latch) with control mechanisms that are either
     manual or automatic in function. As illustrated, the instances of manual
     smart syringes have manually operated actuators which serve to activate
     or unlock the syringe control mechanism. On the other hand, the automatic
     smart syringes have an automatic (electromechanical) mechanism to serve
     the same functionality.
<BR><BR>[0244]In the series of Figures numbered 24 there is illustrated the basic
     smart syringe with an RFID tag and control unit or valve located at or
     near the nozzle. The control mechanism prevents the depression of the
     thumb flange indirectly by the control valve not allowing the contents of
     the syringe from being transferred and therefore dispensed.
<BR><BR>[0245]In the series of Figures numbered 25 there is illustrated a
     latching/locking functionality with the RFID and control mechanism
     located at the finger-flange base of the syringe. The control mechanism
     prevents depression of the thumb flange directly by using a friction grip
     or keyed stop actuator.
<BR><BR>[0246]In the series of Figures numbered 26 there is illustrated the smart
     syringe with a simple operator responsible "go/no-go" indicator. (This
     implementation is among the most vulnerable of the smart syringes due to
     fact it does not contain a secured latch/lock.)
<BR><BR>[0247]In the series of Figures numbered 27 there is illustrated two manual
     implementation embodiments using a rotational and push-pull latch.
<BR><BR>[0248]In the series of Figures numbered 28 there is illustrated two
     implementation scenarios where the RFID tag and control are affixed to
     the syringe: in either a clam-shell arrangement, or removable
     thumb-flange (allowing access to the plunger shaft) whereby the RFID and
     control unit could be slid over and along the plunger shaft to the finger
     flange for securing.
<BR><BR>[0249]In the series of Figures numbered 29 there is illustrated how the
     concept can be extended to legacy syringes, whereby a syringe access
     capsule/enclosure is RFID controlled and enabled prevents miss-use of the
     legacy syringe.
<BR><BR>[0250]In the series of Figures numbered 30 there is illustrated a new
     syringe design where the plunger shaft is modified to incorporate a
     collapsible latch mechanism, such that it can not be activated for use
     until corroborated by an interrogating reader.
<BR><BR>[0251]In the series of Figures numbered 31 there is illustrated possible
     position (resolver) sensors that could be incorporated into the basic
     smart syringe allowing for the position of the plunger itself to be an
     observable/control parameter.
<BR><BR>[0252]In the series of Figures numbered 32 there is illustrated in more
     detail possible thumb-rest removal and attachment mechanisms for the
     purpose of providing better access (both ingress and egress) to the RFID
     control assembly. In doing so, enhancements in both simplicity and
     ergonomics in design are realized.
<BR><BR>[0253]In the series of Figures numbered 33 there is illustrated an
     intersticed design implantation where the RFID with control (valve or
     pinch mechanism) is intersticed between the needle and syringe.
<BR><BR>[0254]In the series of Figures numbered 34 there is illustrated a
     motorized or automatic discharge implementation embodiment using RFID
     with control and actuation.
<BR><BR>[0255]In the series of Figures numbered 35 there is illustrated another
     RFID with control mechanism embodiment with a modified cylindrical
     plunger.
<BR><BR>[0256]In the series of Figures numbered 24 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: RFID with control mechanism at nozzle. FIG. 24A
     illustrates a typical syringe. FIG. 24B illustrates the syringe modified
     to include a position sensor 592, an RFID 212, an optional indicator 596,
     control line 600, and a control valve 604. The RFID 212 would enable the
     control valve 604 allowing the syringe to be discharged.
<BR><BR>[0257]In the series of Figures numbered 25 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe, RFID with control mechanism at finger flange.
     FIG. 25A illustrates a typical syringe incorporating RFID 212 and
     Lock/Latch Mechanism 608 grip release. FIG. 25B illustrates the syringe
     modified to include a friction grip embodiment 612. The RFID 212 enables
     the lock/latch 608 releasing the spring 616 thus releasing the friction
     contact 620 from the plunger contact surface 624 allowing a person to
     discharge the content of the syringe. FIG. 25C illustrates the syringe
     modified to include a keyed stop embodiment 628. The RFID 212 enables the
     lock/latch 608 releasing the spring 632 thus releasing the key from the
     keyed plunger surface 636 allowing a person to discharge the content of
     the syringe.
<BR><BR>[0258]In the series of Figures numbered 26 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: operator responsible RFID with indicator only). FIG. 26
     illustrates the syringe embodiment with RFID 212 and a go/no-go
     indicator, indicating that a person may discharge the content of the
     syringe.
<BR><BR>[0259]In the series of Figures numbered 27 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe, RFID with rotation or push-pull latch mechanism
     at finger flange. FIG. 27A illustrates a typical syringe incorporating
     RFID 212 and go/no-go indicator 640 with a rotate or push-pull mechanism
     to unlock the syringe. FIG. 27B illustrates the push to unlock embodiment
     644. The RFID 212 enables the indicator 640 indicating that the
     restricting mechanism (key in hole) can be released from the keyed
     plunger shaft surface 648 allowing a person to discharge the content of
     the syringe. FIG. 27C illustrates the rotate to lock/unlock embodiment
     656. The RFID 212 and associated electronics are enclosed on a floating
     disk 672 enables the indicator 640 indicating that the restricting
     mechanism (key in hole) on the locking disk 664 can be released from the
     keyed plunger shaft surface 660 allowing a person to discharge the
     content of the syringe. 668 illustrate the teeth on the locking disk and
     the corresponding holes on the keyed plunger shaft 660.
<BR><BR>[0260]In the series of Figures numbered 28 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe, RFID with finger-flange module assembly. FIG.
     28A illustrates a syringe incorporating a removable thumb rest 676
     attachable to the syringe plunger shaft 648 thus allowing the sliding on
     of the RFID 684 ID and control device. FIG. 28B illustrates the
     detachable thumb rest 680 for the case of the slide on RFID unit 684 or
     the permanently fixed thumb rest 680 for the case of the clam shell RFID
     assembly 684
<BR><BR>[0261]In the series of Figures numbered 29 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe, RFID with control for legacy syringes. FIG. 29A
     illustrates a syringe incorporating a lockable slide on cap 688, RFID
     212, and lock/latch mechanism 692. In this manner a typical syringe would
     be housed within locked slide on cap preventing the use of the syringe
     unless enabled by the RFID 212 and lock/latch mechanism 692. FIG. 29B
     illustrates an embodiment with the slide on cap encasing the syringe
     plunger. In this manner a typical syringe (plunger) would be housed
     within locked slide on cap 696 preventing the use of the syringe unless
     enabled by the RFID 212 and lock/latch mechanism 700.
<BR><BR>[0262]In the series of Figures numbered 30 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe, RFID with a collapsible latch mechanism. FIG.
     30A illustrates a syringe incorporating an electromechanical lock 704,
     RFID 212, and cap 708. In this manner a modified syringe plunger would be
     housed within a cap preventing the use of the syringe unless enabled by
     the RFID 212 and electromechanical lock 704. The cap 708 can be withdrawn
     as shown in FIG. 30B with lobe 716 and seat 720 responsible for retaining
     the cap 708 in the withdrawn position attached to the modified syringe
     plunger. In this manner a syringe (plunger) would be housed within locked
     cap 708 preventing the use of the syringe unless enabled by the RFID 212
     and lock/latch mechanism 704. Once the lock is released and the cap
     pulled back and affixed to the plunger the syringe can be discharged. The
     cap can be withdrawn either by pulling it back one the lock is released
     or rotated and pulled back.
<BR><BR>[0263]In the series of Figures numbered 31 is a diagram illustrating
     possible position resolving sensors. FIG. 31A illustrates a means of
     detecting position via resistance 724. FIG. 31B illustrates a means of
     detecting position via shaft encoded friction wheel 728. FIG. 31C
     illustrates a means of detecting position, via a magnetic strip reader
     732, reading position information from a magnetic strip. FIG. 31D
     illustrates a means of detecting position via an optical reader 736
     reading position from an encoded grating.
<BR><BR>[0264]In the series of Figures numbered 32 is a diagram illustrating
     possible removable thumb-rest implementations. FIG. 32A illustrates a
     press fit embodiment 748 where the plunger shaft 744 is pressed into the
     thumb rest 740. FIG. 32B illustrates an insert and rotate embodiment 760
     where the plunger shaft 756 is fit into the thumb rest 752. The thumb
     rest is retained in position by a key and slot mechanism.
<BR><BR>[0265]In the series of Figures numbered 33 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe RFID with Intersticed control device 764. FIG.
     33 illustrates the typical syringe 564 that can be coupled via a standard
     couple 768 to the RFID control valve inclusive of an RFID 212 and flow
     control mechanism. The RFID control valve is also capable of being
     coupled to the syringe accessory 588 (needle, tube, channel, etc.)
<BR><BR>[0266]In the series of Figures numbered 34 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe RFID with motorized control and actuator device.
     FIG. 34A illustrates the typical syringe 564 that can be fitted with a
     RFID controlled actuator motorized plunger 772. The RFID controlled
     actuator motorized plunger 772 is controlled by a motor 776 activated by
     the RFID 212. FIG. 34B illustrates the motor, plunger shaft, and linear
     actuation possible within the present embodiment.
<BR><BR>[0267]In the series of Figures numbered 35 is a diagram illustrating a
     smart syringe: fail-safe RFID with alternative implementation (keyed
     cylindrical plunger 788). FIG. 35A illustrates the typical syringe that
     can be fitted with a RFID 212 and lock/unlock indicator 784 and a RFID
     controlled lock 780. FIG. 35B illustrates the RFID controlled lock 780
     and the RFID from an alternative view. 588 illustrates various
     attachments associated with a syringe.
<BR><BR>Smart Coupler for Medical Applications
<BR><BR>[0268]A "conventional" coupler is a manually operated mechanical device
     used to securely interface and typically connect to another coupler
     (i.e., female to male coupling) to create a passageway to allow for the
     flow of a liquid, vapor, gas, slurry, or dry material (powder), through
     two connected lines, channels, conduits, pipelines, or hoses.
<BR><BR>[0269]The following "Smart Coupler" illustrated in FIG. 37 description
     envelops this basic coupler principle, however offers much greater
     capability and purpose by including a Radio Frequency Identification
     (RFID) tagging 838 device and interface with bi-directional
     communication. A smart coupler 846 can encompass several
     connect/disconnect embodiments. The smart coupler invention described
     here incorporates an RFID tag 838 and accompanying interface (or RFID
     system on a chip) (in situ and/or external) in a method and system to
     control the mechanical operation (e.g., user's thumb) of the act of
     coupling (a male to female mating). By enabling or precluding (with lock
     out pins 842) an instance of user operation of the coupler regulating
     mechanism, two separate lines 200 can be attached or removed or prevented
     from being attached or removed, respectively. Each smart coupler in this
     embodiment are identical and therefore require a mating gateway conduit
     or channel 840 with groves on either side to accommodate locking
     rings/pins of the smart coupler's thumb operated clasping actuator.
<BR><BR>[0270]Hence, in addition to facilitating the flow by coupling two of the
     enabled smart couplers together, through a mating via (gateway), the
     coupler thumb lever mechanism incorporates a lockable-latch which will
     prevent unauthorized, erroneous, or inadvertent operation of the coupler.
<BR><BR>[0271]In a medical instance, smart couplers can be used to safely and
     securely connect medical tubing such as intravenous lines (containing
     medication, testing dyes, or blood).
<BR><BR>[0272]Much of what is discussed about the methods of deployment, regarding
     a smart coupler, also pertains to smart medical devices in general. There
     are parallels to be drawn in both methods and systems regarding RFID
     Enabled Requirements, Enabled Operation, Visual and Auditory Indicators,
     Operation and Protocol, and Recycling--Disposal, Sterilization, and
     Reuse.
<BR><BR>[0273]In FIG. 37 is a diagram illustrating a smart coupling
     device--Male-Female-Male Instance. FIG. 37 shows the tubing 200 affixed
     to a male coupler 846. The male coupler 846 has an RFID tag 838 capable
     of controlling a lock/out pin 842 thus preventing the insertion of the
     male coupler 846 into the female coupler 840.
<BR><BR>Smart Pipette for Medical Applications
<BR><BR>[0274]A "conventional" pipette is a manual or automatic (power assisted)
     injection-mechanical device used to transfer a fluid sample preparation,
     or therapy (liquid or gas), from a reservoir through a holding chamber
     868 and discharge channel, via a nozzle in a controlled and accurate
     manner. Some of the fluid discharge or transfer control variables include
     the direction, volume, rate, and/or pressure of flow. The pipette can
     acquire fluid (sucking up the fluid), contain fluid, or discharge fluid
     (expel fluid) into or from the pipette's holding chamber.
<BR><BR>[0275]The following "Smart Pipette" description envelopes this basic
     pipette principal however offers much greater capability and purpose by
     including a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Reader 850 device and
     interface with bi-directional communication. (It can also have its own
     RFID tag in some embodiments.) The smart pipettes can also communicate
     with a hand held PDA or mobile computer 115, or directly to an existing
     laboratory information and communications system, via wireless access
     points (e.g., 802.11x). The invention itself has a provision for
     discharge (or a means of fluid transfer), and hence delivery, through a
     nozzle and channel (coupler and/or tubing) and/or a hollow needle
     accessory or attachment, for penetration/delivery directly into a host of
     test tubes 864, petri dishes 860, laboratory slides, or other clinical or
     laboratory bins and containers (e.g., flasks).
<BR><BR>[0276]A primary function of the smart pipette is to prevent errors from
     occurring when handling test samples. The RFID enabled lock-out thumb
     activated depressor 858, or fluid release depressor 872, will help
     prevent the operator from placing fluid in an unintended test tube, petri
     dish, or container, by blocking the action entirely, and even providing a
     visual or auditable 874 warning, from the device itself, or through a
     hand held PDA or mobile computer 115. Its ancillary purpose is for the
     monitoring and logging (time stamping) of data and general information,
     and testing or research processes and procedures (for later examination).
     Several benefits can be had in conforming to clinical and laboratory
     standards, protocols, and practices set out by policy makers. For
     instance, improvements in quality control, and efficiency, can increase
     productivity in the facility whilst reducing errors. Proper handling
     protocols in place for the handling and disposing of Bio-hazardous
     materials can also be improved with such a method and system. This can be
     achieved and affected in part by the guidance of a laboratory expert
     system 102b, and overseeing smart medical compliance ICT system 100b.
<BR><BR>[0277]It should also be noted that the recording and time stamping
     features of such a method and system would be particularly useful in the
     developments of new medicines and treatments. It can record parameters
     such as what substances were involved in a particular experiment, when
     they were created, and/or when they were added or removed in any of the
     particular medical apparatuses. Any observations can be entered by the
     technician via his/her PDA device 115 so that it can be stored in a
     laboratory record data base. This can be useful when subsequent (even
     unforeseen) evaluation is required to study particular events that took
     place earlier. For instance, a chemical formula or recipe can be reverse
     engineered with the knowledge stored in the laboratory data base. Also,
     it can be determined when and where certain compositions, compounds, and
     titrations were formed and any intermediate reactions therein.
<BR><BR>[0278]For the purpose of demonstrating the invention of a smart pipette,
     the emphasis (as depicted here) is on a medical, clinical, or laboratory
     setting, and application environment. This serves to demonstrate the
     design, operation, and functionality of a smart pipette, however, it is
     understood that it can be successfully applied to other application areas
     including industrial and commercial usage along these lines.
<BR><BR>[0279]The smart pipette has an electromagnetic field extender 854 (with
     accompanying shield), on or near its discharge tip so that the near field
     communications determined by the RFID Reader 850 is very narrow. In this
     way, the smart pipette will only read (or sense the intended laboratory
     apparatus or specimen). To help facilitate and conform to this
     requirement, a corresponding test tube, petri-dish, sample slide, and
     other tagged apparatuses will all have a "narrow field" RFID tags as
     well.
<BR><BR>[0280]Much of what is discussed about the methods of deployment, regarding
     a smart pipette, also pertains to smart medical devices in general. There
     are parallels to be drawn in both methods and systems regarding RFID
     Enabled Requirements, Enabled Operation, Visual and Auditory Indicators,
     Operation and Protocol, and Recycling--Disposal, Sterilization, and
     Reuse.
<BR><BR>[0281]FIG. 38 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment of a smart pipette
     device. FIG. 38 shows a petri dish 860 with an affixed RFID tag 862 and a
     test tube 864 affixed with an RFID tag 866. The pipette incorporates a
     housing 870, a thumb operated vacuum pump 858, a vacuum release 872,
     power supply 856, fluid chamber 868, RFID reader 868, an audio/visual
     indicator 874, and an RFID field extender 854. Upon corroboration between
     the pipette RFID reader 850 and, for instance, the RFID tag 866 of the
     test tube 864, the lock or latch 852 will be released and the fluid
     delivered to or extracted from the test tube 864.
