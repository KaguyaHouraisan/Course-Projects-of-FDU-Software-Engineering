<BR><BR>[0001]This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application
     No. 60/889105, filed Feb. 9, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Application No.
     60/863821, filed Nov. 1, 2006, and U.S. Provisional Application No.
     60/744188, filed Apr. 3, 2006.
<BR><BR>TECHNICAL FIELD
<BR><BR>[0002]The invention generally relates to tracking and managing life vests
     on aircraft, and more specifically to a life vest configuration suited to
     RFID inspection.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND
<BR><BR>[0003]Aircraft that fly a certain distance over water are often required
     to have a life vest for every person on board that aircraft. To ensure
     the presence of each required life vest, at least two types of inspection
     are often conducted. The first is a pre-flight inspection, which is
     typically made by the flight attendant or gate mechanic. This pre-flight
     inspection confirms the presence of life vests under each aircraft seat
     or where life vests are otherwise required. If any given life vest is
     missing, the life vest is replaced or the seat is not used on the flight.
     The second is a more comprehensive inspection, which is made by mechanics
     as part of routine maintenance. In this type of inspection, the mechanics
     or other authorized personnel not only inspect the life vests for their
     presence but also their expiration dates.
<BR><BR>[0004]Most aircraft life vest inspections are done manually, by a person
     or persons visually confirming the presence of a life vest where one is
     required, then, if necessary, manipulating the life vest to ascertain
     information concerning the life vest, such as, to check the expiration
     date or other information. This information is often printed upon labels,
     the life vest itself, or the life vest's packaging.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY
<BR><BR>[0005]In general, the invention is directed to methods and articles for
     inspecting aircraft life vests using radio frequency identification
     technology (RFID). As one example, computer-implemented RFID-enabled
     inspection devices (for example computers or personal digital assistants
     with RFID functionality) are described that provide graphical user
     interfaces to assist in facilitating the inspection. In a further
     example, the graphical user interface renders a representation of a
     portion of the aircraft, associating visual indicia with areas on the
     aircraft where life vests are expected to be located.
<BR><BR>[0006]As another example, methods are described whereby an employee of an
     airline, or another individual charged with inspecting an aircraft's life
     vests, loads information concerning the aircraft into his or her
     inspection device. The inspector then proceeds to move within the
     aircraft and interrogate RFID tags located upon life vests or life vest
     packaging, and possibly RFID tags that provide proximity information. In
     some embodiments, the proximity information is derived from the stream of
     life vest RFID tag information captured during the interrogation such
     that no proximity RFID tags are necessary.
<BR><BR>[0007]This captured information may be compared to the information
     concerning the aircraft, and the device identifies any exception
     conditions that may be present. For example, an exception condition may
     exist when the inspection device does not receive indication of one or
     more RFID tags where a database or other data store indicates that an
     RFID-tagged life vest should be located. Additionally, an exception
     condition may exist when the inspection device receives information
     indicating one or more life vests are expired, soon-to-be expired, or
     misplaced. The inspector may then remedy the exception conditions as they
     arise, or alternatively the data defining the exception conditions may be
     used to generate an exception report which can be used at a later time to
     remedy any exceptions.
<BR><BR>[0008]The RFID-enabled inspection device may contain an output, e.g., a
     display screen, which provides information to the inspector. This
     information may include visual representations of the aircraft (or
     portions of the aircraft), the locations where life vests are expected,
     and the presence or absence of the life vests. The information may be
     graphically presented and arranged in a manner that facilitates and
     supports the inspector's movement within the aircraft during an
     inspection.
<BR><BR>[0009]In certain embodiments, RFID tags may be located upon, within, or
     within close proximity to the life vests (upon life vest packaging, for
     example). These tags may be located inside of the life vest. Interior
     placement allows for increased protection for the RFID tag against
     tampering and removal. Particularly, placement of an RFID tag on an
     interior surface of the life vest protects the tag from environmental
     risks (such as impact, abrasion, picking, chemical attack, or oxidative
     degradation).
<BR><BR>[0010]In another embodiment, the tags may be manufactured and affixed to
     the life vest or a package containing the life vest so as to function
     differently if an individual tampers with the life vest, the package, or
     the RFID tag itself. For example, the RFID tag may be oriented on a
     package containing a life vest such that upon opening the package, at
     least a portion of the RFID tag is compromised, which renders the RFID
     tag to function differently than had the compromise not occurred. In one
     embodiment, the RFID tag ceases to function entirely upon compromise.
     Alternatively, the RFID tag supplies certain data upon interrogation to
     report the tampering.
<BR><BR>[0011]A variety of approaches to placing an RFID tag on the interior of a
     life vest are described. Examples include having a non-adhered,
     non-secured RFID tag inside the life vest that can freely move within the
     life vest or device. Alternatively, adhesives are described that work
     well on the interior surfaces of life vests. Finally, non-adhesive based
     methods of securing the RFID tag to the interior of a life vest are
     described. These include, for example, the use of ultrasonic welding.
<BR><BR>[0012]In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a human floatation
     device comprising an inflatable, substantially waterproof membrane with
     an interior surface, adapted for use as a human floatation device; a
     radio frequency identification (RFID) device comprising a flexible
     substrate having an antenna and an integrated circuit disposed thereon;
     wherein the RFID device is affixed to the interior surface of the
     waterproof membrane.
<BR><BR>[0013]In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a method for
     making a human floatation device, comprising the steps of providing a
     radio frequency identification (RFID) device comprising a flexible
     substrate having an antenna and an integrated circuit disposed thereon;
     providing a substantially waterproof, flexible first membrane having a
     first side; providing a substantially waterproof, flexible second
     membrane; affixing said RFID device to the first side of the
     substantially waterproof, flexible first membrane; and after affixing the
     RFID device, partially attaching the first membrane to the second
     membrane such that the two membranes define an exterior surface of an
     inflatable device having an interior surface, wherein the first side of
     the first membrane is on the interior surface of the inflatable device.
<BR><BR>[0014]In another embodiment, the invention is direct to a human floatation
     device, comprising an inflatable, substantially waterproof membrane with
     an interior cavity, adapted for use as a human floatation device; and, a
     radio frequency identification (RFID) device comprising a flexible
     substrate having an antenna and an integrated circuit disposed thereon,
     wherein the RFID device is within the interior cavity of the
     substantially waterproof membrane.

     forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other
     features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>[0037]FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a high-level view of a user
     operating a mobile RFID-enabled inspection device to inspect for life
     vests under aircraft seats. Inspector 14, also referred to as user 14,
     uses inspection device 10 to interrogate an RFID tag (or label) 15
     attached to one or more life vests 13 to determine whether the life vests
     are properly located under aircraft seats 12 contained within an
     aircraft. In this example, inspection device 10 includes screen 3, which
     provides visual feedback and possibly directions to user 14. In one
     embodiment, and as described in greater detail below, user 14 uses
     inspection device 10 to inspect the aircraft for present, altered,
     missing, moved, improper, expired, or soon-to-be expired life vests (or
     some subset of this list). Though described herein with respect to using
     RFID technology to inspect for life vests on an aircraft, the same
     techniques may be used to inspect other vehicle types, such as boats,
     tankers, trains, automobiles, trucks, busses, emergency vehicles (fire
     trucks, police cars, ambulances), space crafts, motor bikes, bicycles, or
     any type of vehicle for items such as life vests, fire extinguishers,
     smoke or fire detectors, seats, emergency slides, safety equipment, signs
     and placards, oxygen-generating canisters, oxygen tanks, electronic
     equipment (e.g. entertainment equipment) or any item being time-sensitive
     (e.g. having an expiration, maintenance, and/or calibration date), a
     specific serial number, a specific location or quantity required on a
     vehicle. A vehicle, as the term is used herein, refers to any apparatus
     by which someone travels or something is carried or conveyed. Types of
     vehicles include those mentioned above, but also include aircraft,
     spaceships, satellites, and submarines.
<BR><BR>[0038]User 14 may be any authorized personnel charged with inspecting an
     aircraft for the presence or absence of life vests. The specific role of
     user 14 usually depends on the type of inspection being conducted. User
     14 may go through an authentication process to ensure he or she is
     authorized to make the inspection, or to at least record which particular
     user was facilitating the inspection. This could be done by interrogating
     an RFID tag associated with the user him- or herself, via for example an
     identification badge. There are generally two types of routine life vest
     inspections (there may of course be ad hoc inspections to address other
     needs). The first inspection type is a pre-flight inspection, which is
     typically made by the flight attendant or gate mechanic. This pre-flight
     inspection confirms the presence of the life vest under the seat or where
     otherwise expected. If a life vest is missing, the inspector provides a
     new life vest or the corresponding seat is not used on the flight. The
     second type of inspection is a more comprehensive inspection made by
     mechanics or other personnel as part of routine maintenance. At these
     inspections the life vests are inspected not only for their presence but
     also their expiration dates.
<BR><BR>[0039]Inspection device 10 represents a portable device having an RFID
     antenna, RFID circuitry for interrogating RFID tags, and an internal
     processor or other computing device. The RFID device produces
     electromagnetic fields for interrogating (i.e., communicating with) RFID
     tags 15 attached to life vests 13. Inspection device 10 includes
     inspection device screen 3, which may be any type of screen that conveys
     visual information to a user, but in preferred embodiments is a liquid
     crystal display, or light emitting diode-based display. Screen 3 provides
     visual information to user 14. This information may include information
     about the inspection, such as which life vests 13 have been identified.
     It may also direct user 14 to inspect a certain row, or re-inspect a row
     after an exception condition is identified. Screen 3 displays, in part, a
     graphic user interface to user 14, which facilitates or assists in
     facilitating inspection of the aircraft. Inspection device 10 may also
     include a speaker or other audio device capable of signaling and
     communicating with user 14. The audio device provides useful information
     to inspector 14 to facilitate inspection of the aircraft.
<BR><BR>[0040]Inspection device 10 generates exception reports 2. Exception
     reports may be graphically rendered on screen 3 or printed on paper, or
     otherwise may be any visual or audio indicia that indicates a possible
     exception condition (e.g., the absence of one or more life vests 13, or
     the presence of one or more life vests 13 that are not consistent with
     aircraft records (for example, where the life vest is expired, moved, or
     has been tampered with)).
<BR><BR>[0041]In one embodiment, inspection device 10 provides two general types
     of reports: real-time and summary. Real-time reports include the feedback
     presented to user 14 in the course of an inspection. Real-time reports
     may, for example, show the status of each row/seat for which a life vest
     has been located, as well as seats for which an exception condition
     exists warranting manual follow-up by inspector 14, such as a missing or
     expired life vest. Real-time reports are primarily consumed by inspector
     14. Summary reports contain basically the same type of information as
     real-time reports, but are generated at the conclusion of the inspection.
     They are generally archived as part of an airplane profile, as will be
     discussed further, and may be more appropriate for consumption by, for
     example, regulatory agencies or management.
<BR><BR>[0042]Ideally each life vest 13 on an aircraft is marked with an RFID tag
     15. RFID tags 15 can be selected based on the appropriate frequency. In
     one embodiment, tag 15 functions at a frequency considered for aerospace
     applications (e.g., either 13.56 MHz or 915 MHz). However the invention
     is not limited to these frequencies. The selected frequency may extend or
     limit the read range of inspection device 10. For example, one embodiment
     described below involves interrogating life vest containing areas one row
     at a time. At limited read ranges, it may be necessary to interrogate one
     seat at a time by aiming inspection device 10 at an individual seat, or
     at multiple seats as the range allows. A preferred tag for one embodiment
     might be based on frequencies that give greater read range. Although
     passive tags are mainly considered with respect to the example
     description of this invention, an alternative is to use active tag
     technology, where the RFID tag includes its own power source. If an
     active tag system were used, the read ranges could be sufficient to make
     a complete inspection of the total aircraft from one location.
<BR><BR>[0043]Different methods may be used to store data on RFID tags 15
     associated with life vests 13, and the specific data recorded can be
     tailored to the needs of the airline and life vest manufacturer. In some
     embodiments, the basic data defined by EPCGlobal.TM. Class-1 Generation-2
     Ultra High Frequency RFID Protocol can be used. This is a protocol for
     how data is laid out and collected in the RFID tag. Other protocols could
     also be used. In this example, the data may include a unique identifier,
     manufacturing information (manufacturer, place of manufacture, time of
     manufacture, and other related information), and other data that defines
     and further identifies the life vest (for example, type of vest, or
     maintenance history of the life vest (such at service dates and repair
     type, if applicable)).
<BR><BR>[0044]In some cases, data associated with the life vest is stored on the
     RFID tag itself, and if the data set is small, a 96 Kbit chip will be
     sufficiently large to handle most of the data. Alternatively, the data
     concerning a life vest may be held in a central computer system with
     unique identifier numbers assigned to the RFID tag 13 on each vest. A
     subset of this information can be associated with a particular airplane's
     profile and provided to inspection device 10 before an aircraft is
     inspected, as will be described further.
<BR><BR>[0045]In various embodiments, location information of inspection device
     10, at the point of inspection, herein referred to as inspection device
     location information, is useful at the time of interrogation or later in
     order to identify a negative situation, namely the absence of a life vest
     13 in its expected location (expected location being defined as the data
     set representing the life vests' expected location information).
     Inspection device location information may be used to determine the
     expected state for each seat or other discreet area of an aircraft.
     Expected state information defines, for example, what life vests are
     expected in the coming set of interrogations. For example, when user 14
     interrogates the twentieth row of an aircraft, the inspection device
     location information could be used to automatically look up the twentieth
     row in a database. This look up could retrieve information showing that
     the twentieth row contained two seats, and the two seats have life vests
     with RFID tags that having unique alphanumeric identifiers of A385 and
     E583. Further information retrieved could show that A385 has an expected
     location of seat 20B and an expiration date of Mar. 10, 2015, and E583
     which has an expected location of seat 20A and an expiration date of May
     15, 2017. In this example, the expected state information for the
     discreet inspection event comprises: the fact that the row contains two
     seats, the unique identifiers of the RFID tags on the life vests, the
     expiration information, and the expected location information associated
     with each life. If the interrogation, or inspection, of the twentieth row
     reveals a data set that does not match the expected state information,
     the entire row may be first marked as suspect. Depending on the specific
     information that is retrieved during interrogation, however, some of the
     seats may be deemed to be acceptable, and thus de-marked. This would be
     the case, for example, when there is row of several, say three, seats and
     two of the seats match expected state information. Only the third seat
     would be marked as suspect, which via the user interface displaying
     reports 2 on screen 3, would alert inspector 14 to follow-up on this
     seat. In other words, at a high level, determining whether a life vest is
     absent is a function of comparing the data set of an inspection event
     (for example, the interrogation of a row) to expected state information
     for that row. The same is true for inspection events that are
     seat-by-seat, or possibly aisle by aisle, or plane by plane. If a row has
     one seat, the expected state condition would be defined as such, and the
     comparison between what life vests are present and what are expected to
     be present would only involve one life vest. The particular scope of an
     inspection event is an implementation-specific detail; differing scopes
     may have advantages and disadvantages depending on particulars of the
     application. For example, certain aircraft may be deemed flight-worthy
     after an inspection that shows an acceptable number of life vests were
     confirmed, by inspection of their associated RFID tags, to be onboard an
     aircraft. Or, certain aircraft may be deemed flight-worthy only after an
     inspection that confirms the proper number of life vests have a seemingly
     proper distribution throughout the aircraft (they are not all bunched up
     in a cargo hold in the aircraft's rear, for example). Or, as yet another
     example, certain aircraft may be deemed flight-worthy only after an
     inspection that confirms that each life vest of record under each seat is
     in fact under that seat. These three examples show varying requirements
     of positional resolution--various techniques or combinations of
     techniques may be used to achieve each of these positional resolution
     requirements.
<BR><BR>[0046]Tests of some aspects of various inspection methods were conducted
     on a Boeing 737 and 747, a McDonnell-Douglas DC9 and 10, and an Airbus
     A300. Life vests were installed under seats in five rows of each
     aircraft. Test results are summarized later in this specification. The
     testing revealed instances where, for example, the first seat in the row
     being interrogated was not immediately detected, but seats from adjacent
     rows (or even further away) were detected. These phenomena may be the
     result of metal components in seats, or metal components used in the
     aircraft, which cause multiple signal paths between the inspection device
     and the RFID tags. Further, metal structure within and beneath the seats
     could depolarize radio frequency signals. These phenomena are generally
     termed "multi-path," and certain techniques described herein take
     advantage of them. The term multi-path refers to any interrogation of an
     RFID device wherein the radio frequency traversal path is not direct, and
     is instead reflected or deflected off another surface, or whereby another
     material transmits the radio frequency.
<BR><BR>[0047]Aircraft seats on some aircraft include a metal pan, which may
     operate as an insulating shield. One approach to successful interrogation
     of an RFID tag located under an aircraft seat that contains a metal pan
     is to reflect the radio frequency signal off a conductive surface such as
     the floor of an aircraft, thereby taking advantage of multi-path RFID
     interrogation. The path the radio signals must travel when reflected off
     another surface such as the floor are generally longer than interrogation
     of the RFID tag directly, so an increase in the radio signal power of the
     interrogation device is sometimes helpful, though not always necessary.
     Of course, the increased power may cause other RFID tags under other
     aircraft seats to be successfully interrogated.
<BR><BR>[0048]Expected state information may exist or be derived at several
     levels, and each has advantages or disadvantages. Ideally, expected state
     information is defined for each model interrogation set by inspection
     device 10. A model interrogation set is defined by the scope of an
     inspection event. For example, if inspection device 10 is inspecting the
     aircraft by row (a model interrogation set), expected state information
     would ideally be available by row. An inspection event would be, in this
     example, when the inspector aims inspection device at the row, pulls the
     trigger of inspection device 10, and receives feedback that information
     concerning the row has been received by inspection device 10. Such
     feedback might be, for example, an auditory beep, or an update of visual
     indicia on screen 3. Alternatively, no feedback is needed to define the
     end of an inspection event. The end of an inspection event could be
     defined by protocol if, for example, user 14 merely made sure an
     inspection event was at least a minimum period of time, say two seconds.
<BR><BR>[0049]The life vests 13, with attached RFID tags 15, are delivered to
     either the airline, to be installed on the seats by airline mechanics, or
     alternatively, to the seat manufacturer who will pre-install life vests
     13 on the seats 12 before they are delivered to the airline. FIG. 2 is a
     flowchart showing one example manner in which an airline could receive
     RFID-tagged life vests and place them on aircraft.
<BR><BR>[0050]First, life vests are received by the airline, which have already
     been affixed with RFID tags (2050). As mentioned earlier, the airline may
     receive these life vests already attached to seats, from the seat
     manufacturer. Alternatively, the airline may receive the RFID tags and
     attach them to life vests it already has, or hire contractors to do it.
     This is called retrofitting RFID tags to life vests. Finally, it will be
     appreciated that it is not necessary to affix an RFID tag to a life vest
     itself. Rather, the RFID tag might be affixed to the packaging into which
     the life vest is placed. This technique is described further else ware in
     this specification.
<BR><BR>[0051]Next, the airline may inventory the RFID tag associated with each
     life vest (2051) and receive back from the RFID tag at least a unique
     identifier. With this unique identifier, the airline may then update the
     RFID-enabled life vest tracking system to associate the unique identifier
     with a location on the aircraft where the attached life vest will be
     stored (2052). This location may be, for example, a seat number, which
     may indicate a life vest is associated with the underside of the seat (a
     location where life vests are typically stored on aircraft). Information
     identifying where a life vest is expected to be located is termed a life
     vest's expected location information. The life vest's expected location
     information may either be stored on the RFID tag itself, or it may be
     stored in a database elsewhere, or both. Those skilled in the art will
     appreciate that this is an example only, and that a fully unique
     identifier may not be necessary, especially if a unique identifier may be
     derived from the eventual loading of expected location information onto
     the life vest. In other words, the expected location information may form
     the basis of a unique identifier, either alone or hashed with some other
     identifier, such as a number or key that identifies the particular
     aircraft.
<BR><BR>[0052]Finally, after the unique identifiers associated with each life vest
     have been associated with expected location information, the life vests
     are placed on the aircraft (2053). In a different embodiment, the unique
     identifiers associated with each life vest may be associated with
     expected location information after the life vests have been placed on
     the aircraft by, for example, putting the inspection device into a learn
     mode then stepping through the basic steps of an inspection. Regardless
     of point in which life vests are associated with expected location
     information, once the association is completed, life vests may be
     inventoried using some embodiments of methods, techniques, and devices
     discussed further in this specification.
<BR><BR>[0053]As mentioned, when life vest 13 containing RFID tag 15 is finally
     installed on an aircraft, the RFID tag 15 and thus life vest 13 may be
     associated with a location on the aircraft (the life vest's expected
     location information). The expected location information is usually data
     defining a given seat in the aircraft under which life vest 13 containing
     RFID tag 15 is located, but it could be any information that defines a
     location on the aircraft, such as a seat number or locker location. Life
     vest 13's expected location information can either be stored on life vest
     13's RFID tag 15, or it can be stored in a separate database. For
     example, the information could be stored in a database maintained by the
     airline, then accessed before or after an inspection by user 14. Unless
     otherwise stated, assume for the purposes of example in this
     specification that the RFID tags on life vests contain expected location
     information in the form of seat numbers, and that this information is
     also, or alternatively, contained within a central database of the life
     vest tracking system.
<BR><BR>[0054]In some embodiments, it may not be necessary to associate life vest
     RFID tags with expected location information. Inspector 14 may inspect
     the aircraft without life vest expected location information ever having
     been associated with a life vest. This would be the case, for example, if
     a user supplied the expected location information at the time of life
     vest RFID tag inspection. For example, if user 14 aimed inspection device
     10 at a row of three seats, user 14 would expect three unique RFID tags
     to respond to the interrogation. If three RFID tags where not
     successfully interrogated, user 14 would know there was an issue that
     required further manual inquiry.
<BR><BR>[0055]This approach may be expedient, but may also require ensuring the
     signals being received by inspection device 10 originate from the RFID
     tags associated with the seat or set of seats user 14 is inspecting. For
     example, a problem may arise if device 10 erroneously receives signals
     from life vest tags under seats in front of or behind the groups of seats
     user 14 believes he or she is interrogating. This issue may be addressed,
     however, by adjusting the signal strength emanating from the RFID reader
     and estimating the distance between the inspection device and the RFID
     tag based on the signal strength at which an RFID tag responds to a
     signal or ceases to respond to a signal, measuring the signal strength
     emanating from the interrogated RFID tag, focusing the aim of radio
     signals emanating from inspection device 10, not double-counting RFID
     tags already read, shielding, or other approaches for eliminating or
     ignoring extraneous signals.
<BR><BR>[0056]This technique is just one example of how RFID tags attached to life
     vests could be inspected without associating each RFID tag with expected
     location information. Another way would be to perform seat-by-seat
     inspections in which user 14 places inspection device 10 proximate (e.g.,
     immediately above) each seat such that only an RFID tag under the seat
     being interrogated would be energized and respond to the interrogation.
     In this way, no proximity information need be associated with the life
     vest RFID tag itself in order to confirm the presence of life vests on an
     aircraft. However, there may be benefits in associating expected location
     information with each life vest. In particular, such information may be
     useful as an aid to determining whether a life vest has been moved, which
     may be indicative of tampering and require subsequent follow-up by user
     14.
<BR><BR>[0057]User 14's flow through the aircraft may be self-directed or may be
     directed at least in part by inspection device 10. If the inspection of
     an aircraft is directed by inspection device 10, or must be done in an
     order pre-specified, this is referred to herein as a defined protocol
     inspection. A defined protocol inspection might be, for example, where
     inspector 14 is required to first inspect the first row, then the second
     row, and so forth. Use of a defined protocol inspection may aid
     determining the location of inspection device 10 at any point during the
     inspection. This and other techniques for determining where an inspection
     device is at the point of inspection, will be discussed further else ware
     in this specification. However, in certain embodiments of the invention,
     user 14's flow through the airplane is self-directed for at least the
     pre-flight type inspection, and does not require a defined inspection
     protocol. In other words, in these embodiments, inspector 14 may start
     inspecting aircraft at whatever position he or she likes, may skip over
     seats or sections and come back to rows, and so forth, and the inspection
     is not compromised.
<BR><BR>[0058]FIG. 3A is a functional diagram showing an example embodiment of a
     vehicle inspection system, particularly an aircraft life vest inspection
     system, including inspection device 10, host system 30 and RFID tag
     programmer 40, which collectively support aircraft inspections for life
     vests 13 containing RFID tags 15. Though described herein with respect to
     an aircraft, the same concepts described herein could be applied to
     inspecting items, other than life vests (such as mechanical parts, engine
     parts, electrical parts, smoke detectors, and so forth), on any type of
     vehicle (boats, cars, busses, trains, space ships, satellites,
     submarines, etc.), as one skilled in the art will readily appreciate.
     FIG. 3B demonstrates one example manner in which the inspection system in
     FIG. 3A could be abstracted to apply to inspecting any type of vehicle
     for any type of item or condition on or associated with that vehicle.
     Host system 30 may be a centralized computer system that houses a host
     aircraft profile database 20. Host system 30 also includes user interface
     module 32, and administration module 31, which represent software modules
     executed by one or more processors and stored within a computer-readable
     storage medium. Both of these software modules may be run on a separate
     system or over the Internet on web browsers for example.
<BR><BR>[0059]All databases described herein may be implemented in many ways, as
     will be evident by one skilled in the art. The databases may take a
     variety of forms including data storage files, or one or more database
     management systems (DBMS) executing on one or more database servers
     (which may be running on the handheld, or may be connected to the
     handheld via a wireless link (802.11x, for example)). The database
     management systems may be a relational (RDBMS), hierarchical (HDBMS),
     multidimensional (MDBMS), object oriented (ODBMS or OODBMS) or object
     relational (ORDBMS) database management system. Databases could, for
     example, take the form of a single relational database such as SQL Server
     from Microsoft Corporation.
<BR><BR>[0060]Host system aircraft profile database 20 contains aircraft profiles
     23. Aircraft profiles 23 may include, for example, information about
     particular aircraft. This information may include the type of aircraft, a
     layout of the aircraft, a graphical representation of the aircraft
     including, but not limited to, row, aisle and seat arrangements, storage
     area arrangements, and information defining the expected location of each
     life vest 13 on the aircraft, and possibly the life vest inspection
     history of the aircraft. The aircraft profiles 23 also may include unique
     identifiers for each life vest 13, and these unique identifiers may be
     associated with a location code (such as a seat number) that defines the
     location within the aircraft where a particular life vest 13 should be
     found if it has not been moved. The aircraft profiles 23 may include
     notes or procedures useful to inspector 14 at a time of inspection.
     Aircraft profile may include code, or scripts, that executes on
     inspection device 10 and alters default behavior (for example, the script
     may say that for a given class of plane, a particular life vest not being
     found is not an exception condition). Aircraft profiles 23 may be located
     in locations other than a host profile database 20. For example, profiles
     could exist, pre-loaded or otherwise loaded, onto an inspection device,
     without the use of a central computer. This could be of benefit to
     operations that have a limited number of aircraft, or are otherwise
     uninterested in maintaining a centralized host system 30 The aircraft
     profile could also exist within, and be retrieved from, an RFID tag on,
     within, or in proximity to the aircraft itself. For example, an inspector
     could scan a profile-containing RFID tag, or cluster of RFID tags, which
     contain the aircraft's profile at a particular location in the aircraft,
     as further described herein with respect to aircraft inspection system
     illustrated in FIG. 3C.
<BR><BR>[0061]Host system 30 also includes user interface module 32 and
     administration module 31. Administration module 31 allows the
     importation, updating, reviewing, and reporting of information contained
     within aircraft profiles 23. Administration module 31 also facilitates
     the creation of new aircraft profiles, or the elimination and/or
     archiving of old aircraft profiles. Administration module 31 interacts
     with a user via user interface module 32. User interface module 32 may be
     enabled via a web browser, it may be a standalone program running on the
     same host system as host aircraft profile database 20, or it may be
     hosted on a separate system, in a client-server configuration.
<BR><BR>[0062]Connected to host system 30 is RFID tag programmer 40. RFID tag
     programmer 40 facilitates the inspection and/or programming of RFID tags
     without the use of inspection device 10. In this example, RFID tag
     programmer 40 contains two software modules, one for reading the contents
     of an RFID tag (RFID tag interrogator reader 41) and one for writing
     content to an RFID tag (RFID tag interrogator writer 42). RFID tag
     programmer 40 contains supporting hardware for these software modules
     (not shown). RFID tag programmer 40 is used to inspect RFID tags
     associated with life vests and to reprogram life vest RFID tags. The same
     activity may be done in the field, in the course of an inspection, with
     inspection device 10. However, in some embodiments, it is advantageous to
     centrally manage the distribution of life vests, and centrally maintain
     information about life vest dissemination. RFID tag programmer 40 would
     be used, for example, if an airline issued life vests from a central
     location, at the request of an inspector or automatically via an
     inspection device, wherein the request included an RFID tag be generated
     for a particular location on an aircraft, and this expected location
     information be coded into the RFID tag and also put into the aircraft
     profile 23. A user would use administration module 31, through user
     interface module 32, to program a newly issued RFID tag associated with a
     life vest, and update aircraft profile 23. The life vest would then be
     issued and placed in its proper location by airline personnel.
<BR><BR>[0063]In this example, inspection device 10 is composed of software
     modules 19 and one or more local databases 22 (e.g., inspection database
     16 and inspection device aircraft profile database 17), which may be
     organized in a form suitable for storing and retrieving data within a
     portable device. Software modules 19 interact with databases 22 to
     determine expected location information for life vests, expected state
     information for an inspection event, inspection location information of
     the inspection device 10 at point of an inspection event, and ultimately
     whether a life vest is present, in its proper location, and whether it is
     expired. Other information or attributes could be checked against
     databases 22. In other embodiments, some or all of this information is
     determined remotely by host system 30 based on data retrieved from tags
     15 via inspection device 10. Proximity coordination module 11 determines
     the location of the inspection device at the point of an inspection in
     one of several ways, as described herein, or it may be deactivated for
     certain types of inspections.
<BR><BR>[0064]User interface module 12 facilitates visual interactions with user
     14 via screen 3. Particularly, user interface module 12 draws user
     interface screens that facilitate user 14's inspection of an aircraft for
     the presence or absence of life vests. The specific user interfaces
     produced by user interface module 12 are described later in this
     specification.
<BR><BR>[0065]RFID interrogation module 29 interrogates RFID tags and receives
     information back from the interrogated tag. RFID interrogation module 29
     may also utilize a controlled strength of interrogation signal, as well
     as in some embodiments sensed strength of the return signal from the tag,
     to aid in the determination of the actual locations of RFID tags and
     their associated life vests. Information concerning the interrogation
     generated by RFID interrogation module 29 is placed into inspection
     database 16, where it may be analyzed by validation and exception
     generation module 28.
<BR><BR>[0066]Inspection device aircraft profile database 17 contains one or more
     of profiles 23, or subset of a profile 23, as primarily stored within
     host system aircraft profile database 20, and subsequently downloaded
     onto inspection device 10 in anticipation of an inspection of life vests
     on an aircraft. The profile 23 may be accessed by inspection device 10
     via network 21. Network 21 could be the Internet, or it could be an
     internal, private network. It could be a traditional wired network, or it
     could be wireless. Inspection device 10 uses network 21 to retrieve an
     aircraft profile 23 from host system aircraft profile database 20. As
     mentioned, profile 23 of an aircraft including location information of
     the life vests is preferably done before an inspection of an aircraft,
     but in one embodiment the data validation and comparison is completed
     after the raw data has been gathered via an inspection. In such a
     scenario, inspection of an aircraft is completed, and then the inspection
     data is later analyzed in light of aircraft profile 23, and an exception
     report generated. This functionality may be useful, for example, where
     host system 30 was inaccessible at the time an inspection was initiated.
     In another embodiment, the profiles are stored in the inspection device
     itself, and no host system is necessary.
<BR><BR>[0067]Data export module 18 facilitates the exportation of data from
     inspection device 10. Such data could include an updated profile, such as
     would be generated if a life vest were reconfigured during the course of
     an inspection (for example, the expected location information of a life
     vest were re-set). Data export module 18 also facilitates the exportation
     of reports that summarize inspections, and raw data from an inspection
     for analysis.
<BR><BR>[0068]Validation and exception generation module 28 contains logic that
     assesses inputs generated from other modules, in combination with
     information from the inspection device aircraft profile database 17, and
     determines when life vests are misplaced, expired, or otherwise need
     follow-up. Validation and exception generation module 28 sends this
     information concerning the status of the inspection to inspection device
     aircraft profile database 17, then requests user interface module 12 to
     update its user interface using the new inspection device aircraft
     profile database 17 information. More specifically, validation and
     exception generation module 28 determines or receives inspection device
     location for an inspection event (if this information is received, it is
     received from proximity coordinate module 11; if this information is the
     result of a defined protocol inspection, the inspection device location
     information at the point of an inspection event is determined internally
     to the module). Inspection device location information is used to look up
     in inspection device aircraft profile database 17 what information is
     available concerning expected state of an inspection event. The expected
     state information for an inspection event is compared to actual
     inspection data as placed into inspection database 16 by RFID
     interrogation module 29. From this comparison, the inspection device
     aircraft profile database 17 is updated with information that contains
     the status of life vests; particularly those that have been located,
     those that may have been moved, and those that are expired (the latter
     two categories are marked internally for further follow-up). After each
     inspection event, validation and exception generation module 28 requests
     user interface module 12 to update itself with the information newly
     updated into inspection device aircraft profile database 17 concerning
     the inspection.
<BR><BR>[0069]FIG. 3B is a functional diagram showing an example embodiment of a
     vehicle inspection system. Most components are similar to those described
     with respect to FIG. 3A. However, the system in FIG. 3B regards a more
     general vehicle inspection system, whereby any RFID-tagged item can be
     inspected. For example, host system vehicle profile database 51 contains
     vehicle profiles 50. Vehicle profiles 50 may include information about a
     particular vehicle. This information may include the type of vehicle, a
     layout of the vehicle, a graphical representation of the vehicle
     including row, aisle and seat arrangements (if relevant to the inspection
     of that vehicle), storage area arrangements, and information defining the
     expected location of particular RFID-tagged items on that vehicle, as
     well as, in some embodiments, the inspection history of the vehicle. The
     vehicle profiles 50 also may include unique identifiers for items, which
     may be associated with location codes that define the location within or
     upon the vehicle where a particular item should be found. Vehicle
     profiles 50 may include notes or procedures useful to an inspector at the
     time of, or before or after, an inspection. Such procedures may be part
     of an inspection protocol, including directions indicating where a
     vehicle inspection should start or end. Vehicle profile 50 may include
     code, or scripts, that executes on inspection device 10 and alters
     default behavior (for example, the script may say that for a given class
     of vehicle, a particular item not being found is not an exception
     condition). Vehicle profiles 50 may be located in, and retrieved from,
     locations other than a host system profile database 51. For example, and
     not illustrated in FIG. 3B, the vehicle profile 50s could exist,
     pre-loaded or otherwise loaded, onto an inspection device, without the
     use of a central computer. This de-centralized architecture could be
     attractive to operations having a limited number of vehicles to inspect,
     or not wanting to incur costs associated with a centralized host system.
     Other components described with respect to a life vest inspection of an
     aircraft may operate similarly with respect to inspecting other types of
     vehicles for RFID-tagged components or parts, as will be appreciated by
     one skilled in the art.
<BR><BR>[0070]Whereas FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B are directed toward a system wherein
     inspection device 10 is at times communicatively connected (via network
     21) with a centralized host system, FIG. 3C is directed toward another
     example system which in some embodiments may be more autonomous or less
     centralized. FIG. 3C is a block diagram showing functional modules of an
     inspection device. As compared with the system illustrated in FIG. 3A and
     3B, the inspection device 10 in FIG. 3C includes within it certain
     functionality for managing and administering aircraft profiles 23 that
     was previously available in host system 30. Particularly, inspection
     device 10 in FIG. 3C includes administration module 33. It does not
     necessarily provide the same functionality described with respect to
     administration module 31 in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B. Depending on
     implementation, administration module 33 includes functionality
     associated with creating, updating, and editing vehicle profiles.
<BR><BR>[0071]A system similar to that depicted in FIG. 3C may be suited for
     environments where infrastructure requirements of a centralized host
     system are not practical or undesirable, for example. Further, due in
     part to the fact that most or all necessary software components are
     housed within inspection device 10, deployment may be simplified. Also,
     inspection devices may not need be stored within or associated with a
     particular vehicle, aircraft, or so forth. Rather, any of a plurality of
     inspection devices could be used to inspect any of a plurality of
     aircraft for any of a plurality of things or conditions of interest on a
     particular vehicle. The same inspection device 10 could one moment be
     used to inspect a bus, and the next be used to inspect an aircraft. It
     will be appreciated that the same techniques described with respect to an
     aircraft in FIG. 3C apply to other types of vehicles. For example, one
     skilled in the art will recognize that a common vehicle inspection
     profile definition standard could be deployed such that any inspection
     device 10 supporting a particular profile definition standard could be
     used to receive a vehicle profile, and then use it for inspection of the
     vehicle. Similarly, standardized, possibly industry-sanctioned or adopted
     inspection protocols may be programmatically implemented within
     inspection devices. Then, upon interrogation, inspection device 10 may
     receive information from a vehicle profile-containing RFID chip
     indicating that the profile being transmitted is, say, for a school bus
     versus an aircraft. The appropriate "school bus inspection protocol" may
     already exist within inspection device 10. Alternatively, inspection
     protocols themselves may be contained within the vehicle profile. An
     inspection protocol defines at least some particulars about how an
     inspection takes place, and examples of inspection protocols are
     discussed further below.
<BR><BR>[0072]Where vehicle profile information is received from on-board means,
     such as an RFID tag located somewhere in or on the aircraft and
     containing the aircraft's profile, inspections generally start with the
     interrogation of the profile-containing RFID tag. FIG. 21 shows a
     cut-away of aircraft wall 35 where user 14 is interrogating profile
     interrogation point 34 with inspection device 10. FIG. 21 shows an
     interrogation point on a wall of an aircraft, but this interrogation
     point could just as well be at a plurality of locations within the
     aircraft. For example, one interrogation point might exist for different
     sections of a vehicle (main deck, upper deck, etc.), or there may even be
     an interrogation point on each row that returns row profile information
     with every interrogation of a row. After successful interrogation, a
     vehicle profile is returned to the inspection device, and inspection of
     the vehicle may commence. Profile interrogation point 34 may in one
     embodiment be one or more RFID tags. For the purposes of description and
     not limitation, many of the examples contained herein assume that, when
     the profile is retrieved from an on-vehicle device, the profile comes
     from an RFID tag located within the vehicle. However, one skilled in the
     art will appreciate that the profile-containing RFID tag is just one
     possible means of holding and providing a vehicle profile. Rather than an
     RFID tag, the profile interrogation point 34 could instead merely signal
     an area where inspection device 10 has a strong communication signal with
     a transponder connected to an on-board memory device (a hard drive, flash
     RAM, etc.). The profile could then be wirelessly communicated to
     inspection device 10. In other embodiments, there may be no profile
     interrogation point 34 per se, and instead a wireless access point to a
     network (provided within a suitably equipped aircraft or vehicle), which
     receives the signal from inspection device 10, possibly authenticates the
     signal via one or more security protocols, then responds with the vehicle
     profile. Such a wireless access point type setup may be increasingly
     supported as more vehicles and aircraft include, for example, support for
     wireless networks.
<BR><BR>[0073]FIG. 22 is flowchart showing the high-level process that may be used
     to populate an on-vehicle storage and retrieval system with a vehicle's
     profile. First, a profile storage and retrieval system is installed on or
     in the vehicle (22A). The profile storage and retrieval system could be
     as simple as bar codes or other optically-scanned areas that contain
     information about the vehicle which is used for that vehicle's inspection
     (e.g. the vehicle profile). The profile storage and retrieval system
     could also be an RFID tag, or a cluster of two or more RFID tags, that,
     when interrogated, provide the vehicle profile. Possible RFID tags that
     could be used as the storage and retrieval system for a vehicle profile
     include passive or active, with or without an on-board power source. RFID
     tags can range in storage capacity from less than 1024 bytes to more than
     64,000 bytes. Depending on the size of the vehicle profile, several RFID
     chips may be clustered in one area, each providing a portion of the
     vehicle profile when interrogated by inspection device, which is then
     assembled by the inspection device to form the whole vehicle profile. As
     mentioned above, the profile storage and retrieval system could be an
     on-board computing system, in wireless communication with inspection
     device 10. The profile storage and retrieval system could also comprise a
     computer, possibly a modified personal computer, which emulates an RFID
     tag. The profile storage and retrieval system, though described herein as
     in wireless communication with inspection device 10, need not, in all
     implementations, be wireless. For example, the profile storage and
     retrieval system could interface with inspection device 10 via a
     universal serial bus (USB) connection, possibly to a passive or active
     memory device. Among other things, the use of a USB connection may allow
     for much higher memory storage capacity. Similarly, other memory storage
     devices, such as memory cards, could be used. Even further, the profile
     storage and retrieval system could comprise one or more RFID tags of
     different frequency to those used on items, such as life vests, within or
     onboard a vehicle. For example, the profile-containing RFID tag might be
     a high frequency tag, whereas the RFID tags used to track items might be
     an ultra-high frequency tag. Once the vehicle profile storage and
     retrieval system is installed, the vehicle may be configured with
     RFID-tagged parts (22B). In the case of an aircraft where life vests are
     to be inspected, this step may include actually placing the RFID-tagged
     life vests on the aircraft. Particular configurations will vary by
     application, but this step concludes with RFID tags being situated in the
     vehicle such that they can be interrogated. The vehicle profile is then
     constructed (22C). This may be done by an application within the
     inspection device, in one embodiment, or may be constructed in some other
     computing environment, then transferred and/or uploaded by some other
     device. The specifics of where and how the vehicle profile is constructed
     are an implementation-specific detail. Some implementations may have a
     particular profile that has relevance to a number of vehicles, and the
     profile may change only rarely. In such an implementation, the profile
     storage and retrieval system could be pre-loaded with an appropriate
     profile. If the vehicle's profile changes more frequently (for example,
     seating is often moved, and the RFID-items to be inspected are associated
     with seating), or is more customized (as opposed to more general),
     inspection device 10 may include software that facilitates changing the
     vehicle profile (such as administration module 33). In such a case, a
     generic vehicle profile template may exist initially either on inspection
     device 10 or in the profile storage and retrieval system, which may then
     be updated by inspection device 10. The template may include a data
     structure relevant to a type of vehicle, for example. Finally, the
     vehicle profile is uploaded to the profile storage and retrieval system
     (22D). The particular mechanism used to upload the profile is dependant
     on the technology employed to provide the profile storage and retrieval
     system. For example, if the profile storage and retrieval system is an
     RFID tag or cluster of RFID tags, the RFID tag may simply be re-written.
     Alternatively, if the profile storage and retrieval system is a computer
     system wirelessly connected to inspection device, a <B><I>security protocol</I></B> may
     be invoked before the actual transmission of the vehicle profile. The
     <B><I>security protocol</I></B> may optionally involve an authentication step.
<BR><BR>[0074]The manner in which the vehicle profile is uploaded and stored
     within the profile storage and retrieval system is yet another
     implementation-specific detail. Certain implementations may implement
     standard encryption/authentication algorithms to authenticate either the
     inspection device 10 (if the inspection device is uploading the vehicle
     profile), or the vehicle profile storage and retrieval system. In one
     embodiment, where the profile storage and retrieval system comprises one,
     or a cluster of two or more, ultra high frequency RFID tags, each tag is
     initialized with a unique identifier, which facilitates distinguishing
     one tag from another, as well as interrogating a cluster of RFID tags,
     and then assembling their data. If the RFID tag is destined to be part of
     a cluster of RFID tags, the unique identifier may adhere to a schema
     whereby the identification number itself indicates whether the RFID tag
     is part of a cluster, which cluster it is a part of, and how many tags
     comprise that cluster. This schema may be represented as follows:
<BR><BR>cluster identification #&gt;&lt;RFID tag # within cluster&gt;&lt;total #
     RFID tags in cluster&gt;
<BR><BR>[0075]Data written to the RFID tag may be write-locked, which prevents
     certain tampering efforts by requiring the transmission of a password
     before the writing to the RFID tag. Password-supported RFID tags are
     available in the marketplace by several vendors. Depending on the
     sensitivity or criticality of the data being stored on the RFID tag, the
     data comprising the vehicle profile may be encrypted using known
     symmetric or asymmetric methods. Also, the data may be converted and
     stored in a binary format, which may not be as readily comprehendible as
     more traditional text-storage formats.
<BR><BR>[0076]Data on the tag itself may be formatted in any manner that can be
     read by software running on inspection device 10. An extensible markup
     language format could easily be adapted to describe relevant particulars
     about the vehicle being inspected. One exemplary format schema, in this
     case adapted for use inspecting aircraft, is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0077]Each physical RFID tag that is part of the profile storage and
     retrieval system includes a header containing the following information:
<BR><BR>[0078]1) Data map version number. This number indicates which formatting
     version is used for storing the vehicle profile data on the RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0079]2) Full write indicator bit. Inspection of this bit indicates
     whether the RFID tag was written successfully. Among the first steps in a
     write operation is to set this bit to false. Then, writing of the RFID
     tag commences. A final step is to set this bit to true.
<BR><BR>[0080]Subsequent reads of the RFID tag confirm the bit is set to true. If
     it is not set to true, this may be indicative of a data integrity issue.
<BR><BR>[0081]The RFID tag additionally includes a header section containing
     information about the aircraft profile. It may include, for example, the
     following information:
<BR><BR>[0082]1) Aircraft registration number. Unique number for the aircraft
     (e.g. N123456).
<BR><BR>[0083]2) User ID. Identifier of the person who wrote the configuration to
     the config tag.
<BR><BR>[0084]3) Location. Name entered by user to define the location where the
     configuration was written
<BR><BR>[0085]4) Datestamp. Indicates when the aircraft profile was written to the
     tag (e.g. 12/22/06 13:23).
<BR><BR>[0086]5) Config tag full write indicator. This operates in concept similar
     to the full write indicator bit, but pertains to the entire cluster
     instead of an individual RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0087]The remaining memory for the RFID tag may contain the following
     information, optionally spread across multiple RFID tags as a cluster:
<BR><BR>[0088]1) Seat map name. User defined unique name (e.g. A330-300 v2 333)
<BR><BR>[0089]2) Seat map update date/time. When the profile was last modified and
     saved on the inspection device.
<BR><BR>[0090]3) Active. Boolean defines if this is the active seat map if there
     are multiple seat maps for a given aircraft registration number.
<BR><BR>[0091]4) Main Deck information. Information defining layout information
     regarding aircraft's main deck.
<BR><BR>[0092]a. Number of aisles
<BR><BR>[0093]b. Max number of seats per row
<BR><BR>[0094]c. Total number of seats

<BR><BR>[0097]f. Aisle 1 position
<BR><BR>[0098]g. Aisle 2 position (omit if not needed)
<BR><BR>[0099]5) Upper Deck information. Information defining layout information
     regarding aircraft's upper deck, if one exists.
<BR><BR>[0100]a. Number of aisles (if 0, then rest of upper deck info is omitted)
<BR><BR>[0101]b. Max number of seats per row.
<BR><BR>[0102]c. Total number of seats
<BR><BR>[0103]d. Total number of storage locations
<BR><BR>[0104]e. Inspection start row
<BR><BR>[0105]f. Aisle 1 position
<BR><BR>[0106]g. Aisle 2 position (if not needed)
<BR><BR>[0107]6) Seat Pattern information. This section helps conserve config tag
     memory requirements by listing each pattern only once.
<BR><BR>[0108]a. Number of seat patterns-Main Deck. A seat pattern is a sequence
     of codes that defines the seat letters in a row (e.g. ABC.about.DEF to
     indicate seats A, B, C, an aisle, and then seats D, E, F)
<BR><BR>[0109]b. For each main deck pattern:
<BR><BR>[0110]1. Pattern ID.

     segment. Describes similar row sequences of seats as segments.
<BR><BR>[0117]a. Number of seat segments. A segment is a section of seats with the
     same seat pattern.

     for example: Adult Life Vest, Infant Life Vest, and Crew Life Vest. This
     list may be expanded in the future to include other items such as first
     aid kit, blankets, etc.
<BR><BR>[0134]ii. Item Quantity. The quantity of this item expected in the storage
     location.
<BR><BR>[0135]FIG. 23 is a flowchart showing one example manner in which a user
     such as inspector 14 may inspect a vehicle such as an aircraft, where the
     vehicle profile (in this case the aircraft profile) is available within
     an on-vehicle profile storage and retrieval system. First, inspector 14
     retrieves inspection device 10 (23A). Inspection device 10 may be located
     in an area in proximity to the vehicle to be inspected, such as at a gate
     an airport, or at a maintenance facility. Inspection device 10, in one
     embodiment, need not be located on the aircraft. Next, the vehicle
     profile is retrieved from the on-vehicle profile storage and retrieval
     system (23B). As mentioned above, the process by which the vehicle
     profile is retrieved is dependant on how the vehicle profile is stored
     (RFID versus computer system or otherwise). In the case where the profile
     storage and retrieval system is an RFID chip, the profile interrogation
     point would be an RFID tag, and the inspector would interrogate the
     proper area (possibly marked as such), and receive the vehicle profile.
     Next, inspector 14 commences inspection of the vehicle (23C). The vehicle
     profile may be loaded and interpreted to provide instructions regarding
     the inspection (an inspection protocol). Alternatively, inspector 14 may
     have been trained to execute a proper inspection protocol, so no
     instructions need be provided on the inspection device. When the
     inspection is complete, inspector 14 may follow-up on exceptions
     discovered as part of the inspection (23D). This follow-up may include,
     as the case may be, remedial activities, such as replacing life vests
     found missing, or otherwise noting exception conditions for later
     reporting. In some implementations, once one or more inspections is
     complete, inspection data may optionally be uploaded from the inspection
     device to another computer system for archival, analysis, report
     generation, or other purposes (23E). For example, if the inspection
     routine being used in FIG. 23 were being used to inspect an aircraft for
     life vests, the entity responsible for maintaining the aircraft may want
     reports indicating which aircraft were inspected and what the inspections
     showed. Inspection device 10, in some embodiments, includes the ability
     to store data resulting from an inspection of a vehicle. Depending on the
     storage capacity of inspection device 10, resultant data sets from many
     inspection events could be stored for later off-load.
<BR><BR>[0136]FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating one example process in which
     inspector 14 may use inspection device 10 to inspect for life vests 13
     using RFID tags 15. In this particular example, inspection device
     location information is not used. In other words, analysis of whether a
     life vest is present or absent turns entirely on the presence of the RFID
     tag associated with a life vest, and there is no assessment of whether
     the life vest's expected location information is accurate. With respect
     to the system software diagram of inspection device 10 as represented in
     FIG. 3A or FIG. 3B, proximity coordination module 11 would not be
     necessary for the type of inspection illustrated in FIG. 4 and may be
     deactivated. This inspection method could be coupled with a defined
     inspection protocol, say seat-by-seat in ascending order, to produce a
     very high degree of certainty that a life vest is present or absent from
     beneath a given seat.
<BR><BR>[0137]The inspection starts with the retrieval of an aircraft profile
     (401). The aircraft profile may be retrieved from host system aircraft
     profile database 20, or may come from an interrogation of an aircraft
     profile-containing RFID tag located on, or in proximity to, the aircraft.
     The profile may only be a subset of the entire profile--for example it
     may only define the seating configuration of the aircraft, contain a
     graphic rendering of the aircraft (or contain enough information such
     that a graphic rendering could be done by user interface module 12), and
     include expected location information for each life vest with an
     associated RFID tag on the aircraft (if such expected location
     information is not already present on the RFID tag itself). Receiving a
     profile at the start of an inspection may not be necessary, and the
     system, in one embodiment, accommodates the possibility that a profile
     simply isn't available. There are several ways to proceed with an
     inspection in the absence of an aircraft profile. For example, if
     expected information location for a life vest is already on the RFID tag,
     the profile is not critical. Alternatively, expected state information is
     supplied by inspector 14 (when inspecting a row of three seats, three
     life vest "pings" should come back, and the inspector is watching for
     this), no information from profile 23 is necessary. The new profile
     information is put into inspection device's aircraft profile database 17.
<BR><BR>[0138]Next, inspector initiates an aircraft inspection event (402). This
     is accomplished, for example, by inspector 14 pressing a button on
     inspection device that activates an RFID tag interrogation routine, or
     otherwise signaling to the inspection device that an inspection is to
     begin. Inspector then begins discreet inspection events by pressing a
     trigger on inspection device 10 when the device is aimed suitably at an
     aircraft seat or row of seats or other target area (403). Data comes back
     from the RFID tag affixed to a life vest or a life vest's packaging, and
     is received by inspection device 10 (404). The inspection database 22 is
     updated with this information, along with any other information on the
     tag itself (such as the date the life vest was placed in service or the
     expiration date of the life vest) (405). Validation and exception
     generation module 28 updates inspection device aircraft profile database
     17 with the life vests that have been inventoried, and for example
     whether the life vest is expired. Validation and exception generation
     module 28 then requests user interface module 12 to update the user
     interface with this new set of information. In this way, feedback is
     presented to the user concerning the state of the inspection. At any
     point, inspector 14 may signal to inspection device 10 that the
     inspection is complete (406). Until then, the process loops back to the
     interrogation of life vest RFID tags (403) until the entire aircraft has
     been inspected. In another embodiment, it is not necessary to initiate
     discreet inspection events associated with aircraft rows or other areas.
     Rather, the inspection event is started for the entire aircraft, and a
     user moves through the aircraft with the inspection device constantly
     emitting an RF signal, and the inspection device noting any information
     read from RFID tags.
<BR><BR>[0139]When inspector 14 indicates the inspection is complete (406), an
     exception report is generated (407) which inspector 14 or another person
     follows-up upon (408). The exception report shows life vests that require
     further inspection or analysis. If different life vests are put under
     seats, this information is updated in the aircraft profile, and expected
     location information possibly written to the RFID tag itself. The
     profile, updated to reflect the life vest configuration of the
     just-inspected aircraft, is then sent back to host system aircraft
     profile database 20, which synchronizes any updates (409). At this point,
     an inspection is complete. On implementations that do not rely on a
     centralized host system aircraft database, the profile information, in
     one embodiment, would be updated into an updated profile within the
     inspection device.
<BR><BR>[0140]FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating another example process for
     inspection of an aircraft for missing, moved, or expired life vests. The
     example inspection detailed in FIG. 5 differs from the inspection
     detailed in FIG. 4 in that the inspection in FIG. 5 uses inspection
     device location information at the time of an inspection event. This may
     allow for automatic determination of whether a life vest has been moved,
     which may be indicative of tampering, thus warranting follow-up by
     inspector 14.
<BR><BR>[0141]The inspection starts with the retrieval of an aircraft profile from
     host system aircraft profile database 20 (501). Alternatively, the
     aircraft profile may already be on in the memory of the inspection
     device, or may be otherwise acquired, as, for example, by interrogating
     an RFID tag that holds the aircraft profile. The profile may only be a
     subset of the entire profile--ideally it need only define the seating
     configuration of the aircraft, contain a graphic rendering of the
     aircraft (or contain enough information such that a graphic rendering
     could be done by user interface module 12), and include expected location
     information for each RFID tag-associated life vest on the aircraft (if
     such expected location information is not already present on the RFID tag
     itself). Receiving a profile at the start of an inspection is not
     necessary, and the system accommodates the possibility that a profile
     simply isn't available. There are several ways to proceed with an
     inspection in the absence of an aircraft profile. For example, if
     expected information location for a life vest is already on the RFID tag,
     the profile is not critical. Alternatively, expected state information is
     supplied by inspector 14 (when inspecting a row of three seats, inspector
     14 makes sure three life vest "pings" come back from an interrogation)
     and no information from profile 23 is necessary. Alternatively, an
     inspector could query seats and subsequently compare to profile
     information to determine exceptions (expired, missing, or moved life
     vests).
<BR><BR>[0142]Next, inspector initiates an aircraft inspection event (502). This
     is accomplished, for example, by inspector 14 pressing a button on
     inspection device 10 to activate an RFID interrogation routine. Inspector
     then begins inspection events by pressing a trigger on inspection device
     10 when the device is aimed suitably at an aircraft seat or row of seats
     or target area (503). Data is received from the RFID tag affixed to a
     life vest or a life vest's packaging, and is processed by inspection
     device 10 (504). Device 10 updates the inspection database 22 with this
     information, along with any other information on the tag itself (such as
     the date the life vest was placed in service or the expiration date of
     the life vest).
<BR><BR>[0143]Next, location information of inspection device 10 at the time of
     inspection is determined (505). Inspection device location information is
     determined by proximity coordination module 11, where the inspection
     device location information is derived from external data feeds.
     Alternatively, inspection device location information could be derived
     from a defined inspection protocol followed by inspector 14, as discussed
     above. When inspection device location information is based on a defined
     inspection protocol, it does not come from proximity coordination module
     11, and instead is deduced within validation and exception generation
     module 28.
<BR><BR>[0144]There are several approaches to determining the inspection device's
     location information at the time of an inspection: by protocol (discussed
     previously), by the use of proximity tags, or by heuristic data modeling
     techniques. Each of these approaches is considered in more detail in
     upcoming discussion with respect to FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C.
<BR><BR>[0145]The inspection device location information is used by validation and
     exception generation module 28 to determine various characteristics of an
     inspection event. These various characteristics comprise expected state
     information for an inspection event, discussed earlier. The specific
     constituent data elements of expected state information is a function of
     what is available to compare expected state information against in order
     to derive meaningful information for inspector 14. For example, if the
     aircraft subject to inspection contains life vests for which expected
     location data is available (say for example, life vests #43, 25, and 58
     are positioned beneath a row of three seats, which seat numbers are 34A,
     34B, and 34C), the expected state information would include the life vest
     numbers (43, 25, and 58) for the row. It would not necessarily include
     expected seat numbers, nor would it necessarily include the row number,
     as neither of these things could be validated. If, however, seat numbers
     or row numbers can be validated with an acceptable level of certainty at
     the time of inspection, then this data would be part of the expected
     state information. Validation and exception generation module forms its
     expected state largely from information held within the aircraft profile
     held in inspection device aircraft profile database 17, and particularly
     the data sets within the aircraft profile 23 that define the locations
     where life vests are expected. Expected state information also includes
     life vest expiration date information, in the form of an expiration date,
     or the date in which the life vest was placed in service.
<BR><BR>[0146]Ultimately, validation and exception generation module 28 uses what
     data it has available and forms a data set that represents the expected
     state of the subject of an inspection event (an inspection event would
     be, as mentioned earlier, for example, the interrogation of a row). The
     actual data that comes back from an RFID interrogation event, carried out
     by RFID interrogation module 29 and placed in inspection database 16, is
     then accessed. A comparison is made between an inspection event's
     expected state, and its actual state. Matches and mismatches are noted in
     the inspection device aircraft profile database 17 (506).
<BR><BR>[0147]Validation and exception generation module 28 may then request user
     interface module 12 to update the user interface with the new set of
     information in inspection device aircraft profile database 17. In this
     way, feedback is presented to the user concerning the state of the
     inspection. At any point, inspector 14 may signal to inspection device 10
     that the inspection is complete (507). But until then, the process loops
     back to interrogation of the life vest RFID tags (503) until the entire
     aircraft has been inspected or the user indicates the inspection event is
     complete ("yes" at 507).
<BR><BR>[0148]When inspector 14 indicates the inspection is complete (or the
     device indicates the inspection is complete) (yes at 507), an exception
     report is generated (508) which inspector 14 or others follow-up upon
     (509). The exception report shows life vests that require further
     inspection or analysis. If different life vests are put under seats, this
     information is updated in the aircraft profile, and expected location
     information possibly written to the RFID tag itself. The profile, updated
     to reflect the life vest configuration of the just-inspected aircraft, is
     then sent back to host system aircraft profile database 20, which
     synchronizes the updates (510). At this point, an inspection is complete.
<BR><BR>[0149]FIG. 6A through 6C are flow charts illustrating example sub-routines
     that could be used to determine location of inspection device in step 505
     in FIG. 5. The first, illustrated in FIG. 6A, is to use a defined
     inspection protocol that is followed by user 14. For example, a defined
     inspection protocol could be that inspector 14 first scans a first row,
     then a second row, and so forth. In such an inspection, the inspection
     device location information can be ascertained by inspection device 10 by
     looking up an internal representation of the protocol (6A1). The protocol
     may be defined on a one-aisle plane such that user 14 first uses
     inspection device 10 to first inspect (interrogate) the starboard side of
     the aircraft, then the port side, then move on to row two and so forth.
     If there is more than one aisle on the aircraft, such that there is a row
     of seats in the middle, this would be further defined by the protocol. In
     this manner, when protocol instructs an inspection of row 36, information
     received back is presumed to be from row 36. Based on the inspection
     protocol being followed, the handheld device may be able to ascertain its
     location on the aircraft. In one embodiment, a plurality of inspection
     protocols are contained within inspection device and inspector 14 may
     select among the protocols before starting an inspection. For example,
     inspector 14 may choose among two protocols, one whereby the aircraft is
     inspected starting in the rear of the aircraft, and another whereby the
     aircraft is inspected starting in the front of the aircraft. When
     following a defined protocol inspection, and interrogating row-by-row, a
     list of all life vest tags read, and not just those tags in the
     currently-interrogated row, may be maintained within inspection device
     10, along with the location of inspection device 10 as determined by
     protocol. Additional data may also be stored within inspection device 10,
     including for example the level of the radio frequency transmit power
     that was used to successfully interrogate the tag (in certain embodiments
     the signal strength may be varied during an interrogation event--for
     example the radio frequency signal strength increased during an
     interrogation event). At intermediate points in the process of the
     inspection, or perhaps more typically at the end of an inspection
     (defined inspection protocol is complete), or even real-time, the data
     collected may be processed with an algorithm executing on inspection
     device 10, or the data off-loaded to another computing system and
     similarly analyzed. The algorithm would, in one embodiment, determine the
     probable location of each life vest successfully interrogated. For
     example, the algorithm may be programmed such that if a particular life
     vest was originally installed in row 13, and the life vest responded to
     interrogations of rows 12, 13, and 14, the probability is high that the
     life vest currently resides in its original, and correct, location. One
     skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments of this approach to
     scanning could similarly be implemented in the absence of data defining
     where life vests are located on an aircraft. In such a scenario, an
     inspection may still be able to determine, with acceptable accuracy, that
     there are likely enough life vests on an aircraft to meet requirements,
     and/or that there are a correct number and distribution of life vests, by
     row or section, for example, on the aircraft. Alternatively, the protocol
     could be specified by the user 14 such that user 14 specifies to
     inspection device 10 the row user 14 is going to inspect or has just
     inspected.
<BR><BR>[0150]FIG. 6B is a flow chart illustrating a method to determine location
     information of inspection device 10 by interrogating a positional RFID
     tag associated with, for example, a row of an aircraft (6B1). This
     information may be the row itself, or it may be a unique identifier of a
     row, which must then be looked up in a database to determine the actual
     row number. Ultimately, however, the row is determined (6B2). One of
     ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other tags, or identifiers,
     could be used to convey information concerning an interrogation. For
     example, bar codes could be placed in proximity to every expected RFID
     inspection location on an aircraft, and the bar code could be scanned at
     the same time, or just before or after a row of seats is inspected with
     RFID inspection device 10. For example, an RFID tag could be placed on
     every row of the aircraft, and when interrogated, respond with the row
     number it is within. In this manner, when row 36 is inspected by
     inspection device 10, the RFID tag defining the row responds that the row
     is indeed the 36th, along with any life vest RFID tags.
<BR><BR>[0151]FIG. 6C is a flow chart illustrating a method of determining
     inspection device location information via a heuristic data analysis
     technique. A heuristic data analysis technique in this context does not
     rely on location markers or other information specifically identifying
     the location of an inspection device at the point of an inspection.
     Rather, heuristic data analysis techniques analyze the data that has been
     gathered and tries to estimate where the inspection device likely is
     located. A simple heuristic data technique is described and shown with
     respect to FIG. 6C. First, data from a life vest inspection event is
     retrieved and reviewed (6C1). The data is next associated with life
     vests. For a set of life vests identified per the life vest inspection
     event, a first life vest RFID tag is assessed to determine where its
     expected location information says it should be (6C2). This location is
     presumed to be correct (6C3). The process is repeated for each life vest
     identified in the life vest inspection event. If any life vest indicates
     it should be in a different row or location, the entire row may be marked
     as suspect, and then flagged for subsequent follow-up to confirm whether
     there is an actual issue.
<BR><BR>[0152]Other heuristic data analysis methods could be used to determine
     inspection device location information at the point of inspection. For
     example, a sliding window technique could be employed where a set of
     sequential identifiers (N), read from the life vest's RFID tags, are
     compared using a best-fit pattern match to the ordered set of identifiers
     within the database. The set of N recently read identifiers is "slide"
     through the database until the best matching position for the window is
     determined, thereby providing an indication of the current location of
     the inspection device.
<BR><BR>[0153]In other embodiments, combinations of protocol, location markers,
     and heuristic techniques may be combined. For example, in one embodiment,
     an RFID device is initially positioned in the aircraft at a given
     location. A marker tag there is scanned, providing the RFID inspection
     device with initial coordinates within the aircraft. Inspection device
     then uses other techniques (protocol or heuristic or inertial) to
     determine where the inspection device is in relation to the marker tag.
<BR><BR>[0154]An inspection of an aircraft for life vests may, in one or more
     embodiments, be aided with an inspection device 10 executing life vest
     inspection code in the form of a computer program. Inspection device 10,
     in one embodiment, contains software including user interface module 12,
     that may generate various graphic user interfaces on screen 3 that assist
     inspector 14 in inspecting life vests 13 on an aircraft. FIG. 7 shows
     example information contained within aircraft profile 23 about the
     aircraft subject to inspection, which inspection device 10 may utilize to
     graphically render all or a portion thereof on screen 3. Particularly, a
     seating arrangement is provided as part of the profile. For example, the
     seating arrangement can be used by inspection device 10 to show example
     seat number 291 is located in a particular location on the aircraft. FIG.
     8 is an example user interface showing display window 3000. Display
     window 3000 shows a series of visual indicia, in the form of small
     squares or rectangles, each corresponding to a seat on the aircraft that
     is being inspected. The individual squares correspond to seats on the
     aircraft, such as seat 3001 corresponds in this instance to seat 1A. The
     visual indicia are initially set to a first color, such as gray, that
     indicates that inspection device 10 has received no information to
     determine a particular life vest has been accounted for. The inspection
     is done with inspection device 10 by rows or partial rows. For example,
     row 3002 may be interrogated in two halves. Though FIG. 8 only shows a
     few rows of an aircraft, each expected life vest on the aircraft may have
     corresponding visual indicia within the graphic user interface, and the
     visual indicia may correspond to more than seat numbers. For example,
     various locations on a plane may have spare life vests, or may contain
     special life vests, such as for children. These locations are not
     generally under aircraft seats. These and other locations would be
     similarly represented in the user interface, and visual indicia would
     similarly indicate the expected presence of a life vest in these other
     locations.
<BR><BR>[0155]While making the aircraft life vest inspection, inspector may
     interrogate rows or other locations where life vests are expected, visual
     indicia representing the locations of life vests on the aircraft as
     displayed on screen 3 may be updated to reflect the presence of the RFID
     tag associated with a particular life vest. FIG. 9 shows an example
     screen rendering wherein a visual indicium 3102, associated with seat 1A
     on the aircraft, has been updated to reflect the presence of an RFID tag
     associated with a life vest. In FIG. 9, the visual indicium is a light
     hash mark. In one embodiment, the visual indicium is the color green.
     Inspector 14 may quickly and easily look at inspection device 10's
     display screen 3 to see the various life vests that have presumptively
     been located. A second type of visual indicia may be used for instances
     where the life vest is located, but is expired. Expired life vest visual
     indicium 3101 may be, for instance, the color yellow.
<BR><BR>[0156]While inspecting the aircraft, inspector 14 may receive output from
     display screen 3 of inspection device 10 and quickly determine which
     visual indicia are either red (no RFID tag corresponding to the life vest
     has been detected), or yellow (RFID tag corresponding to the life vest
     having been located, but being expired or otherwise requiring follow-up
     (for example, the life vest may not be in the correct location, or the
     life vest has been tampered with)).
<BR><BR>[0157]FIG. 10 shows a rendering of an example screenshot that shows how
     the screen scrolls as the inspector makes his or her way through the
     aircraft. Particularly, FIG. 10 is an example screen rendering a few
     seconds after the rendering of FIG. 9, after inspector has moved closer
     to row 3204. Seat 3102 is now partially obfuscated by the border of the
     display window, and the new row 3204 is beginning to appear at the top of
     the window. User interface module 12 provides a scrolling view of the
     aircraft and the inspection device's location within the aircraft by
     updating display window 3000 whenever new information regarding a change
     in the location of inspection device 10 is available to user interface
     module 12. User interface module 12 attempts to render display window
     3000 such that the next row to be interrogated is slightly above the
     middle of display window 3000.
<BR><BR>[0158]FIG. 11 is a flowchart showing an example process to update visual
     indicia representing locations of expected life vests in user interface
     window 3000. Initially, user interface module 12 renders a graphic
     representation of the aircraft, including at least enough detail to
     distinguish discreet areas in which a life vest may be expected to reside
     (3301). In other words, the graphic representation need not be overly
     detailed, but it must at least show all of the places on an aircraft
     where life vests would traditionally be stored or located.
<BR><BR>[0159]Next, user interface module 12 associates a visual indicium with
     each expected location of a life vest (3302). The expected locations of
     life vests may come from a database pre-loaded with information about
     specific life vests located in discreet locations. This database would be
     loaded into inspection device aircraft profile database 17 as part of the
     aircraft profile 23, described above. Alternatively, if this information
     is not available, user interface module 12 uses a default mapping of life
     vests within the aircraft that defines the minimum life vest
     configuration necessary for the aircraft to make a flight. Additionally,
     default layouts of most aircraft, in the form of partial profiles, may be
     stored within the inspection device 10. Thus, if no detailed information
     about a given aircraft were available as part of its profile, user
     interface module 12 would assign a visual indicium to each seat in the
     aircraft, as defined by the default aircraft profile.
<BR><BR>[0160]At this point, user interface module 12 is ready for an inspection
     to begin. Inspector 14 may begin interrogating RFID tags 15 associated
     with life vests 13 (3303). Information that comes back from an RFID
     interrogation at minimum includes a unique identifier, and may
     additionally include the RFID tag's last-registered location (for example
     the seat number that the life vest was last registered under). If the
     location information is not included in the set of information that comes
     back from the RFID tag, this positional information may be contained
     within inspection device aircraft profile database 17, and thereby
     cross-referenced. There are other techniques, described in greater detail
     above, that could be used to determine either the actual or expected
     location of a life vest (for example, via inspection protocol, via a
     separate RFID tag that includes location information, or via heuristic
     methods). No matter the details of a particular technique (those skilled
     in the art may appreciate myriad techniques), proximity coordination
     module 11, in one embodiment, determines the expected location of the
     interrogated life vest 13 RFID tag 15, and passes this location
     information to user interface module 12 (3304) via inspection device
     aircraft profile database 17. The location may either be the expected
     location of the life vest, or it may be the actual location of the life
     vest, or it may be both. In one embodiment, it is both, which allows for
     the identification of an exception condition wherein the life vest is
     present, but is out of place. In an embodiment already described, and as
     will be used for the illustrative purposes of this example, the location
     information is merely the expected position of the life vest, contained
     within a life vest's RFID tag, in the form of a seat number. The expected
     position of the life vest would have been registered on the tag when the
     life vest was placed under a particular seat. For purposes of
     illustration, let us presume the information received from the tag
     interrogation (3303) and the location determination (3304) revealed the
     tag was #58237, and its expected position is under seat 7B. Validation
     and exception generation module 28 determines a code for the given seat
     for which information is available. The code defines the inspection
     status of life vest. In one embodiment, the codes are as follows:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00001
    TABLE 1
    Life Vest Inspection Code Meaning
    1 RFID tag associated with life vest
     responded without incident.
    2 RFID tag associated with life vest
     responded, but indicates the tag is expired.
    3 RFID tag associated with life vest
     responded, but expected location does not
     equal actual location.
<BR><BR>[0161]As will be evident to one skilled in the art, the use of life vest
     condition codes other than 1 is dependant on the availability of data to
     support these codes. The non-existence of data to support life vest
     condition codes 2 or 3 does not obviate the need or value of doing an
     inspection that only reveals life vest condition code 1 s. However, life
     vest condition codes 2 and 3 provide a more thorough inspection, and have
     supporting processes described elsewhere in this specification. Preferred
     embodiments gather enough data to support all inspection codes.
     Validation and exception generation module 28 passes the location code,
     7B, along with a condition code, in this case 1, indicating the life vest
     was found, to user interface module 12, via inspection device aircraft
     profile database 17, which updates the visual indicium associated with
     seat 7B to be, in this case, from gray to green (3305). Other indicia
     useful to the user could be used alternatively or in combination with a
     color change. For example, an auditory signal could be sent when a life
     vest was properly located, and a different auditory signal sent when a
     condition other than that represented by code 1 was sent (everything but
     code 1 requires follow-up by inspector 14 or another authorized person,
     so an auditory indicium, such as a beep, may indicate required
     follow-up).
<BR><BR>[0162]The interrogation/inspection portion of the process is repeated
     (3306) until inspector 14 indicates the aircraft life vest inspection is
     complete, or all life vests that are expected have been accounted for, at
     which point the inspection is stopped (3307).
<BR><BR>[0163]FIG. 12 is a flowchart showing an example operation of another
     aspect of display window 3000, namely the manner in which its graphic
     representation of the interior of the aircraft scrolls as user 14 moves
     inspection device 10 within the aircraft, and as further represented in
     FIG. 10. The scrolling functionality is produced by first rendering a
     graphic representation of the aircraft (3401), the same as described in
     regard to FIG. 11. Next, each expected life vest is associated with a
     visual indicium within the graphic representation (3402), again the same
     as with regard to FIG. 11. Next, the graphic representation and its
     corresponding visual indicia are rendered onto the screen along with
     scroll bar 3205, with an initial position at the front of the aircraft
     (3403). The length of the scrollbar corresponds to the length of the
     graphic representation of the aircraft, which corresponds to the aircraft
     itself. User 14 may move box 3206 along scroll bar 3205 to inspect the
     graphic representation of the aircraft, and more particularly the status
     of visual indicium associated with each life vest 13 on the aircraft.
<BR><BR>[0164]Next, inspection device 10 may determine its location within the
     aircraft (3404). As mentioned above, there are several methods to
     ascertain this positional information. Some include the use of an
     inspection protocol, the use of positional RFID tags located at various
     positions throughout the aircraft, and the use of heuristic data modeling
     techniques that determine the supposed position of the interrogation
     device based on the life vest RFID tags being interrogated, and perhaps
     the order of the interrogation.
<BR><BR>[0165]Inspection device location information is sent to user interface
     module 12, which renders a new display window 3000 wherein the row just
     interrogated is positioned slightly below midpoint of the Y-axis of
     screen 3, and the next row anticipated to be interrogated is positioned
     just above the midpoint of the Y-axis of screen 3 (3405). These last two
     steps are repeated via the "done with inspection" check (3406) whenever
     new information describing the location of inspection device 10 is
     available, and in one embodiment, after each discreet inspection event.
     When the "done with inspection" check (3406) is true, the inspection may
     be complete (3407).
<BR><BR>[0166]If an aircraft profile containing the aircraft's seating
     configuration is not available, in one embodiment, inspection device 10
     presents inspector 14 with a series of questions that allow inspector 14
     to define the aircraft's seating position in an ad hoc manner. The
     inspector is presented with a series of questions, such as the number of
     rows, the number of aisles, the number of seats in a row, and so forth.
     There is then a dialog allowing the addition of alternative locations for
     life vests not associated with the seating arrangement (such as spare
     life vests and child life vests). FIG. 13 is a flow chart representing an
     example manner in which the construction of aircraft profile, graphically
     driven by user interface module 12, could work.
<BR><BR>[0167]First, inspector 14 initiates configuration of a new aircraft event
     (3501). This would be done, for example, by pressing a button on
     inspection device 10, or if screen 3 is touch-sensitive, touching a
     portion of the screen indicating inspector 14's desire to manually
     configure the aircraft profile. Next, the user is presented with a series
     of questions: How many rows in the aircraft? (3502); How many aisles in
     aircraft? (3503); How many rows in a specific class section of the
     aircraft (class being first class, coach class, etc.)? (3504). The class
     question (3504) begins an iterative process by which each class is
     defined, then subsequently information is gathered about that class of
     seats. The remaining steps 3505 through 3508 encompass this iterative
     process. Questions about seat configuration (a surrogate for most
     information about life vest location configuration) continues until
     inspector 14 indicates there is no further class in the aircraft (3508),
     at which point inspector 14 is able to add, in an ad hoc manner, other
     information about where to expect life vests on the aircraft (3509-3512).
     If there are no further life vests expected on the aircraft, inspector 14
     indicates such at 3509, and the aircraft configuration event is completed
     (3513).
<BR><BR>[0168]FIG. 14 shows example attachment of RFID tag 15 to life vest 13. In
     one embodiment, RFID tag 15 is placed on the exterior of life vest 13, as
     is illustrated by RFID tag 15A. Alternatively, the RFID tag may be place
     on packaging into which the life vest is stored on an aircraft. Placing
     an RFID tag on packaging into which the life vest is stored is discussed
     in greater detail below. In one embodiment, RFID tag 15 is placed on the
     interior of the life vest, as illustrated by RFID tag 15B, as illustrated
     in a cutout view (101) of life vest 13.
<BR><BR>[0169]FIG. 15 shows an exemplary view of a life vest 13 cut out. A first
     and a second membrane (1101 and 1105) represent two layers of material
     typically used in life vest production. The membranes have an exterior
     surface (1107 and 1108) as well as an interior surface (1109). The
     exterior surface is typically nylon. The interior surface is typically a
     coating of polyurethane (PU). The PU coating usually gives the life vest
     its substantially waterproof characteristics, while the exterior nylon
     gives the life vest durability against exposure and abrasion. Flexible
     circuit substrate 1104 is comprised of an electrically insulating
     material having a suitable dielectric constant, such as fiberglass or
     plastic. An electronic circuit 1103, such as an application specific
     integrated circuit (ASIC) or discrete logic components, is electrically
     connected to the antenna 1102 disposed on the flexible circuit substrate
     layer 1104.
<BR><BR>[0170]There are several ways to ensure the RFID tag is securely within the
     life vest. Three are discussed herein, but those skilled in the art will
     recognize several approaches could be employed. One method is to use an
     adhesive. Adhesive layer 1106 exemplifies this approach. Adhesive layer
     may include various primers, or it may not be necessary at all if other
     non-adhesive-based techniques, as described below, are employed.
<BR><BR>[0171]A first example way to affix an RFID tag to the interior of a life
     vest includes the use of a particular type of adhesive in adhesive layer
     1106, which is designed to work well in the unique operating environment
     of the interior of the life vest 13.
<BR><BR>[0172]As mentioned, interior surfaces of life vests typically comprise a
     coating of polyurethane (PU). PU has a low surface energy, which makes it
     a difficult surface to adhere to. Conventional acrylic-based adhesives
     popularly used on RFID devices may not adhere well to PU or other low
     energy surfaces. Adhesion of RFID tag 15 to the interior PU-based surface
     1109 of life vest 13 may be accomplished, however, by using a high
     performance adhesive designed to work with PU. A preferable adhesive
     system includes an adhesion promoter such as one known under the trade
     designation "3M.TM. Adhesion Promoter 86A" and a pressure sensitive
     acrylic adhesive transfer tape or acrylic adhesive transfer tape, such as
     the class of low surface energy laminating adhesives 300 LSE available
     from 3M.TM., and specifically adhesives known under the trade
     designations, "3M.TM. 9485PC", "3M.TM. 9934XL", or "3M.TM. 9472E".
<BR><BR>[0173]Various adhesives were tested to adhere the RFID label to the
     interior surface of a life vest. The interior surface of the life vest
     comprised a thin, continuous, smooth coating of PU. Life vests used for
     the test were from Eastern Aero Marine, Inc, 5502 NW 37th Avenue, Miami,
     Fla. 33142, under the trade designation Adult/Child Life preserver, Model
     UXF-35, FAA-TSO-Cl3f The RFID tag used for the tests was purchased from
     Alien Technology 18222 Butterfield Blvd., Morgan Hill, Calif. 95037,
     under the trade designation "ALL 9354-02 (M)". The adhesives used in the
     tests are available from 3M.TM. of St. Paul, Minn., under the trade
     designations specified in Table 2, except for the Alien.TM. adhesive,
     which was pre-applied to the Alien RFID tag. The primer used is available
     from 3M.TM. of St. Paul, Minn., under the trade designation "3M.TM.
     Adhesion Promoter 86A". The primer layer may also be provided by a
     variety of resins including but not limited to any hydroxy functional
     vinyl resin (e.g., VAGH from Union Carbide Corporation of Houston, Tex.),
     any carboxyl functional resin (e.g., VMCH also from Union Carbide Corp.),
     or any amine functional resin. Polyamide primer layers such as MACROMELT
     6240 from Henkel Corporation of Dusseldorf, Germany, may also be used.
     These primers are best applied by dissolving in a suitable solvent (e.g.,
     isopropyl alcohol) and wiping onto the area to be adhered. Other ways to
     prepare the PU surface could be used, including as a non-limiting
     example, a Corona treatment. Labels were adhered to the inside of the
     life vests behind the exterior text panel. Labels in this position did
     not exhibit any degradation in RFID-related performance throughout the
     testing process. It was clear from initial testing that labels attached
     to a surface without the use of the primer did not adhere as well as the
     when the primer was used. This was true for every adhesive tested.
<BR><BR>[0174]Life vests 13 were tested using the following inflation test to
     assess how well the adhesives work during real world use. The inflation
     test is an FAA approved test for life vests and is conducted on life
     vests every 5 or 10 years, depending on the type of vest. The life vests
     were pressurized to 2-4 PSI (0.014-0.028 MPa) and held under pressure for
     1-2 minutes. Observations were made and the vest then deflated, folded,
     and packed as they would be in preparing for placement within an
     aircraft. This process was repeated 5 times, which is typical of the
     number of life vest test cycles the life vest may undergo in its
     operational life. All RFID tags functioned after the test. Further, no
     life vest leaked air after any test. However, RFID tags adhered to the
     life vest's interior surface without the use of primer detached from the
     life vest surface and became free-floating within the life vest cavity
     upon light shaking in some cases, and no shaking in others.
<BR><BR>[0175]Adhesives were applied to a polyester backing (the same as would be
     found on an RFID tag), then adhered to the PU surface of one-inch strips
     of life vest material. Both a 5-minute and a 72-hour, 180-degree room
     temperature peel test were performed as per ASTM-D3330 test method A on
     the different adhesive systems mentioned above. Each test was performed
     three to five times to arrive at an average peel strength value. Table 1
     summarizes results of the testing.

<BR><BR>[0176]A second example way to affix an RFID tag 15 to an interior surface
     of life vest 13 is by the use of high frequency welding. This was
     achieved using the following technique. The RFID tag was placed on the
     inside of the vest and held in position using the adhesive already on the
     tag as supplied by Alien.TM.. A section of PU-coated nylon fabric two
     inches larger (overlapping) than the RFID tag in the X and Y direction
     was then placed centrally over the RFID tag. The section of PU-coated
     fabric was oriented in such a way that the PU-coated surface of the cover
     and the PU surface of the vest were adjacent to each other. The assembly
     was then placed under the HF welding horn of a FIAM Welding machine Model
     #3005 LF, manufactured by, FIAB System AB, S-453 29 Lysekil, Sweden.
     Sufficient energy (power and time) was applied to the horn to weld the PU
     layers of the two fabrics together. This process was repeated on each of
     the four sides of the patch, thus enclosing the RFID label in the HF
     welded patch.
<BR><BR>[0177]A third example way to affix an RFID tag 15 to an interior surface
     of life vest 13 is through the use of mechanical fasteners, such as hook
     and loop, which have been adhered to a surface of the life vest.
     Refastenable fastening devices of the hook and loop-type are currently
     used widely in a great number of situations. Such refastenable fastening
     devices have been used in clothing, disposable articles, and various
     miscellaneous articles such as safety belts and the like. Such devices
     are used when it is desirable to create a refastenable bond between two
     or more articles or between several surfaces of the same article. In
     certain applications, these refastenable fastening devices have replaced
     conventional adhesives, buckles, zippers, buttons, snaps, tie fasteners,
     and sewing.
<BR><BR>[0178]A popular type of mechanical fastener currently in wide use which
     utilizes mechanical entanglement to create a refastenable bond is sold
     under the trademark "VELCRO". VELCRO fastening devices are described in
     greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 2,717,437, U.S. Pat. No. 3,009,235, U.S.
     Pat. No. 3,266, 113, U.S. Pat. No. 3,550,837, U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,303,
     and U.S. Pat. No. 4,984, 339. Other types of mechanical fasteners are
     described by 3M in U.S. Pat. No. 4,894,060, U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,770, U.S.
     Pat. No. 5,679,302, U.S. Pat. No. 6,000,106 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,814,912.
<BR><BR>[0179]Mechanical fasteners utilize two components, a male component and a
     female component. The male and female components are often referred to as
     the hook and loop components, respectively. The hook component consists
     of a fabric which contains a plurality of resilient, upstanding
     hook-shaped elements. The female component of the fastening device
     consists of a fabric containing a plurality of upstanding loops on its
     surface. When the hook component and the loop component are pressed
     together in a face-to-face relationship to close the fastening device,
     the hooks entangle the loops forming a plurality of mechanical bonds
     between the individual hooks and loops. When these bonds have been
     created, the components will not generally disengage under normal
     conditions. This is because it is very difficult to separate the
     components by attempting to disengage all of the hooks at once. However,
     when a gradual peeling force is applied to the components, disengagement
     can be easily effected. Under a peeling force, since the hooks are
     comprised of a resilient material, they will readily open to release the
     loops.
<BR><BR>[0180]A fourth example way to locate an RFID tag 15 to an interior surface
     of life vest 13 is to place the RFID tag inside of the life vest at the
     time of manufacture, not adhered or otherwise affixed to any interior
     surface of the life vest. RFID tag 15B would then be free to move around.
     This free movement would not necessarily pose problems as initial
     placement and subsequent folding during the manufacturing process may
     adequately orient the tag. Unfolding of life vest 13 usually does not
     take place during an inspection process. Rather, the life vest is
     typically unfolded during a re-certification process, which can happen
     5-10 times in the life of the vest. It is possible, however, that a
     freely moving RFID tag 15B could end up in a position within life vest 13
     wherein its ability to send or receive radio signals is diminished or
     compromised. This might happen, for example, if RFID tag 15B were
     situated in close proximity to a radio insulation or reflection
     component, such as life vest inflation mechanism 102. Life vest inflation
     mechanism 102 typically contains a CO2 cartridge made of metal. This and
     other components of a life vest may prevent RFID tag 15B from performing
     as intended. Free movement may be restricted by the creation of an
     interior compartment, or cavity, within the life vest that restricts the
     movement of RFID tag 15B.
<BR><BR>[0181]As mentioned above, an alternative to placing RFID tag 15 on the
     interior or exterior of life vest 13 is to place it on the life vest
     packaging. When placed on life vest packaging, the use of a particular
     type of RFID tag, in a particular configuration, may render the life vest
     packaging tamper evident and enable remote identification of packages
     that may have been tampered with. Particularly, an RFID tag placed across
     the tear path of a package inside of which the life vest has been placed
     will be destroyed or rendered inoperable when the package is opened.
<BR><BR>[0182]FIG. 16 shows an example configuration of life vest 13, folded (13B)
     and placed within package 2101. RFID tag 15 is situated on package 2101
     in a manner such that it not practical to gain access to the life vest
     without compromising RFID tag 15. Package 2101 includes tear tag 2102.
     Not all life vest packaging has such a rip tag. There are generally two
     types of aircraft life vest packages: 5-year and 10-year. A 5-year
     package is usually composed of a flexible polymer such as polyethylene,
     and includes a tear tag, such as tear tag 2102 made of a tear-resistant
     plastic, which is attached to surface of the package, and the package
     closed by stitching the surfaces together. Pulling tear tag 2102 opens
     package 2101 by producing a uniform slit across the package. A 10-year
     package is usually made from the same material as the life vests: nylon,
     coated with PU. To assist in opening a 10-year package, a notch is cut
     into the fabric so a tear can propagate in the desired direction. Package
     2101 is a 5-year type, and further life vest package examples presented
     herein are drawn generally to a 5-year type of package. This focus on a
     5-year type package is for illustrative purposes only. As will be
     appreciated by one skilled in the art, this invention may be easily
     applied to a 10-year type package, and any existing or to-be-conceived
     packaging solution that includes a mechanism for accessing the package's
     contents along a pre-defined region of the package's membrane.
<BR><BR>[0183]FIG. 17 shows a more detailed view of example package 2101. In
     particular, RFID tag 15 is shown, and perforation 2103 in RFID tag 15 is
     situated such that its apex intersects a tear line 2104 that defines an
     eventual opening line, such that by pulling tear tag 2102, the resulting
     lateral slit will compromise the RFID tag. The compromise of the RFID tag
     may take several forms, but in a preferred embodiment, the RFID tag
     antenna is separated into two parts and thereby rendered inoperable. If
     using life vest inspection methods described elsewhere in this
     specification, the inoperative RFID tag would result in the associated
     life vest being considered missing or compromised, and would compel
     subsequent follow-up, which would likely mean physical inspection. If the
     package were found to be compromised, the life vest in the package would
     be re-packaged (if the life vest was found to be in satisfactory
     condition). Alternatively, if a package were found to be compromised,
     then a replacement package containing a life vest would be substituted
     for the compromised life vest.
<BR><BR>[0184]The inoperability of the RFID tag, in one embodiment, is the result
     of the RFID tag's antenna being separated from the RFID tag's integrated
     circuit. This may be accomplished by situating the RFID tag upon the tear
     line 2104 in a way such that the slit will either disconnect the RFID
     tag's antenna, or disconnect a sufficiently large portion of it that the
     practical result is the same.
<BR><BR>[0185]One or more tear propagation points (small slits or holes) in
     flexible circuit substrate 1104 can significantly enhance the sensitivity
     of the RFID tag to compromise. FIG. 18A through 18D show examples of
     pre-slitting flexible circuit substrate 1104. RFID tag 15A shows flexible
     circuit substrate 1104 without any tear propagation points. It includes
     antenna 1102 and integrated circuit 1103. Antenna 1102 and integrated
     circuit 1103 repeat in example views of RFID tags 15B, 15C, and 15D, but
     for clarity they are not explicitly specified with respect to the figure.
     RFID tag 15B shows flexible circuit substrate 1104 with two lateral
     notches or slits, 2201, that, when connected, intersect integrated
     circuit 1103 at approximately a 90 degree angle. A tear down this slit
     would compromise the RFID device by destroying the integrated circuit
     antenna interface. RFID tag 15C shows tear propagation points, in this
     case slits 2201, variously positioned along a first edge of flexible
     circuit substrate 1104, with a similarly situated set of slits positioned
     along the flexible circuit substrate's second edge. The slits do not need
     to be aligned, and there need not be slits on both edges--the slit is of
     particular use on the edge closest to the start of the tear propagation
     point. Putting slits on both edges makes application of the tags less
     error-prone (there are multiple orientations that will work). A tear
     across any of these slits would compromise the antenna. For some RFID
     tags, the compromise of the antenna will render the RFID device
     inoperable. For other RFID devices, the device may still work, but work
     differently. For such RFID devices that are not rendered inoperable
     merely due to antenna compromise, the integrated circuit is designed such
     that it will not function if any antenna circuit is broken. RFID tag 15D
     shows an alternative configuration of the slits, such that they run
     substantially parallel to the longer axis of RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0186]915 MHz Alien.TM. (of Morgan Hill, Calif.) Squiggle.TM. ALL-9338-02
     EPC RFID tags were used in testing various tear propagation points, or
     slit configurations. RFID tags were attached to five and ten year
     packages using a pressure sensitive adhesive that came on the RFID tag,
     and an adhesion promoter (3M.TM. A86, mentioned above) if needed. FIG.
     19A and 19B show various placement positions of RFID tags on life vest
     packages. Specifically, FIG. 19A shows placement on a five year vest, and
     FIG. 19B shows placement on a ten year vest. On the five year vests (FIG.
     19A), the tags were placed as follows: A--on the exterior surface of the
     package across the tear line (2104), on top of the stitched on tear label
     1943 (such tear labels allow a user to grip a member that facilitates the
     tear in the tear propagation line 2104, and is available on certain life
     vest packages); B--on the outside of the package on top of the stitched
     tear line (2104), away from the stitched tear label 1943; C--placed on an
     interior surface of the package before it is stitched together, located
     on the tear propagation line 2104; D--placed on the outside of the
     package, but underneath the tear label 1943. On the ten year vests (FIG.
     19B), the tags were placed as follows: E--on the exterior of the package
     across the tear line 2104; F--placed on the interior of the package
     before the package is sealed via high frequency (HF) weld. Testing of
     RFID tags on life vest packages involved first putting slits on the RFID
     tag's flexible circuit substrate 1104 (if needed). Second, the RFID tag
     was placed on the life vest package such that a pair of slits
     approximately aligned with tear line 2104. The specific mechanism of
     attaching is described earlier, but in all cases the attachment mechanism
     was sufficiently strong as to hold the RFID tag in place throughout the
     testing. Third, the RFID tag was tested to ensure it operated properly,
     and was readable after attachment to the package but before opening the
     bag. Fourth, the package was opened along tear line 2104 using the
     appropriate mechanism (either tear tag 2102 or a tear notch). The RFID
     tag test passed if, upon package opening, the RFID tag was compromised
     and thereby rendered inoperable. Table 3 shows the results of the
     testing.

<BR><BR>[0187]Most configurations passed the test (that is, the RFID tag was not
     readable after opening the bag, which is indicated by a "true" in the
     last column of Table 3). Three tests did not use a pre-slit RFID tag. The
     first, AAMD-2, used an adhesive that was later determined to be poorly
     suited for the application. AAMD-3 used 3M.TM. PSA 8617 with the surface
     treated with 3M primer A86 (described further above). The RFID tag
     adhered well to the surface and did not allow the package to be opened by
     normal forces at the tag across tear line 2104. With no slits, the tear
     strength of the RFID tag (with a polyester backing) was sufficiently high
     such that either the adhesive failed before the RFID tag's flexible
     circuit substrate was compromised, or the RFID tag's flexible circuit
     substrate prevented the package from being opened. The other test made
     with no pre-slitting was AAMD-9. In this test, the package was a 5-year
     type, with a tear line comprised of stitching. The RFID tag failed, but
     the failure was likely due to the fact that slits were, in effect,
     punched in the RFID tag's flexible circuit substrate by the stitching
     process, and these slits or holes acted as rip propagation points.
     Generally, if no rip propagation points (holes or slits) exist, then it
     is necessary to use a backing material for the flexible circuit substrate
     that is weak enough to tear. Such a layer could, for example, be paper.
<BR><BR>Testing
<BR><BR>[0188]As mentioned earlier, RFID inspection methods were tested on a
     Boeing 737 and 747, a McDonnel-Douglas DC9 and 10, and an Airbus A300.
     RFID tags were placed between the underside of the seat bottom and the
     life vest for each seat in five contiguous rows within each aircraft. The
     impact of metal seat pans on interrogation using two transmit powers, 18
     dBm and 19 dBm, was tested on a DC 10 that did not initially have metal
     pans in its seats. A first set of interrogations was completed in this
     native state, then with installed metal plates under each seat cushion.
     FIG. 20A through FIG. 20H summarize aspects of the test methodology and
     results.
<BR><BR>[0189]FIG. 20A is an exemplary user interface as might be displayed by an
     inspection device guiding a user inspecting the aircraft. The screen
     shows a graphical representation of the seating configuration of the
     aircraft being inspected. Particularly, numbered boxes represent seats,
     and form rows and aisles. The user interface, in this example, is an
     exemplary screenshot captured at the start of an inspection. Positional
     information regarding the inspection device, in this example, is garnered
     from an inspection protocol, which is presented to the user via the user
     interface. In other words, inspection device's display screen advises the
     user of the order in which to scan ("Press Trigger to Scan 25A,B." After
     an inspection event has concluded, for example by the user pressing and
     releasing a trigger on an inspection device, instructions on the
     inspection device may then read, "Press Trigger to Scan 26A,B."
<BR><BR>[0190]FIG. 20B shows how testing of metal plates/radio transmit power on a
     DC 10 was executed. A user interrogated rows 20B1, and received signals
     back from seats 20B2, and moved per an interrogation event order
     specified by order 20B3. FIG. 20C is a key to assist in reading results
     of the testing, which is summarized in the table of FIG. 20D. FIG. 20D
     summarizes the absolute value read range for each interrogation event at
     transmit powers of 18 and 19 dBm, respectively. FIG. 20E is a graphic
     illustration of median read range achieved when metal pans are present
     under seats, using a radio transmit power of 18 dBm. FIG. 20F is a
     graphic illustration of median read range achieved when metal pans are
     not present under seats, using a radio transmit power of 18 dBm. FIG. 20G
     is a graphic illustration of median read range achieved when metal pans
     are present under seats, using a radio transmit power of 19 dBm. FIG. 20H
     is a graphic illustration of median read range achieved when metal pans
     are not present under seats, using a radio transmit power of 19 dBm.
<BR><BR>[0191]Various implementations and embodiments of the invention have been
     described. For instance, methods of inspecting an aircraft, and
     supporting systems and graphic user interfaces have been described.
     Further, various configurations concerning the placement of an RFID tag
     on a life vest have been described, as have RFID tags placed on packaging
     and prepared in such a way that the life vest package is tamper evident.
     Nevertheless, it is understood that various modifications can be made
     without departing from the invention. Accordingly, these and other
     embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.
