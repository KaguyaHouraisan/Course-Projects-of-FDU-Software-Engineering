     Application No. 60/396,577 filed Jul. 16, 2002. All of the above
     applications are hereby incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>FIELD OF INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002]This invention generally relates to tracking resource performance,
     and more particularly, to tracking the performance of resources using
     Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in contact and contactless
     environments.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0003]A variety of hardware and software applications exist which, in a
     limited way, allow companies to keep track of resource performance. For
     example, many systems exist wherein a resource (e.g., employee) manually
     enters in the time spent on a task on a time card or a similar reporting
     device. However, there is a need for coordinating time card and task
     reporting with project planning. Microsoft Project.RTM. is a software
     application that allows companies to plan and track projects in order to
     increase business performance and efficiency. However, most
     project/resource management tools require a resource to manually enter
     and plan a project. For example, the resource must often decide a
     project's scope, the kind of tasks associated with the project, the
     number of resources needed, and the availability of resources. Many
     times, the decisions are not accurate because a resource often attempts
     to merely predict the scope of these items. Further, if problems develop
     along the way, the resource typically must reschedule and try to account
     for the problems. Moreover, most project/resource management tools do not
     combine time entry with resource and task planning. Thus, a manager may
     assume that a resource is logging eight hours a day on a task, but in
     reality, the resource may only be logging five hours.
<BR><BR>[0004]Additionally, the available project/resource management tools do not
     generally provide for grading or scoring of resources and/or resource
     efficiencies. It may be difficult, therefore, to plan the effectiveness
     of different resources. For example, a senior engineer may be more
     efficient and effective at a given task than an entry-level engineer.
     Further, because of the global aspect of many businesses, certain
     managers monitor resources located in remote places. However, most
     project/management tools do not offer standard criteria for grading and
     tracking resources to assist in remote management. Further, many
     project/management tools do not provide sufficient capabilities for
     matching a resource to tasks most-suited to the resource's skill levels.
<BR><BR>[0005]Manual entry and project management can lead to inaccuracies in
     reporting and planning. While other systems exist where a resource and/or
     manager can interface with a software application to track progress on a
     task, report time, and/or project plan, these software applications still
     require manual interfacing. Thus, a method for instantaneous and
     automatic task reporting, performance tracking and project planning is
     desired.
<BR><BR>[0006]In terms of automation, companies are increasingly embodying RFID
     data acquisition technology in a fob, token or tag for use in completing
     transactions. A typical fob includes a transponder and is ordinarily a
     self-contained device which may be contained on any portable form factor.
     In some instances, a battery may be included with the fob to power the
     transponder. In which case the internal circuitry of the fob (including
     the transponder) may draw its operating power from the battery power
     source. Alternatively, the fob may exist independent of an internal power
     source. In this instance the internal circuitry of the fob (including the
     transponder) may gain its operating power directly from an RF
     interrogation signal. U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,774 issued to Schuermann
     describes a typical transponder RF interrogation system which may be
     found in the prior art. The Schuermann patent describes in general the
     powering technology surrounding conventional transponder structures. U.S.
     Pat. No. 4,739,328 discusses a method by which a conventional transponder
     may respond to a RF interrogation signal. Other typical modulation
     techniques which may be used include, for example, ISO/IEC 14443 and the
     like.
<BR><BR>[0007]One of the more visible uses of the RFID technology is found in the
     introduction of Exxon/Mobil's Speedpass.RTM. and Shell's EasyPay.RTM.
     products. These products use transponders placed in a fob or tag which
     enables automatic identification of the resource when the fob is
     presented at a Point of Sale (POI) device. Fob identification data is
     typically passed to a third party server database, where the
     identification data is referenced to a resource (e.g., resource) credit
     or debit account. In an exemplary processing method, the server seeks
     authorization for the transaction by passing the transaction and account
     data to an authorizing entity. Once authorization is received by the
     server, clearance is sent to the point of sale device for completion of
     the transaction. In this way, the conventional transaction processing
     method involves an indirect path which causes undue overhead due to the
     use of the third-party server. As such, a RFID system which includes
     instantaneous and automatic task reporting, performance tracking and
     project planning is desired.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0008]A system and method for facilitating the use of RFID technology to
     track resource performance and task completion is disclosed. The
     transponder-reader system described herein may include a RFID reader
     operable to provide a RF interrogation signal for powering a transponder
     system, receiving a transponder system RF signal, and providing
     transponder system account data relative to the transponder system RF
     signal. The transponder-reader system may include a RFID
     protocol/sequence controller in electrical communication with one or more
     interrogators for providing an interrogation signal to a transponder, a
     RFID authentication circuit for authenticating the signal received from
     the transponder, a serial or parallel interface for interfacing with a
     point of interaction terminal, and an USB or serial interface for use in
     personalizing the RFID reader and/or the transponder. The
     transponder-reader system may further include a fob including one or more
     transponders (e.g., modules) responsive to one or more interrogation
     signals and for providing an authentication signal for verifying that the
     transponder and/or the RFID reader are authorized to operate within the
     transponder-reader system. In this way, the fob may be responsive to
     multiple interrogation signals provided at different frequencies.
     Further, the fob may include a USB or serial interface for use with a
     computer network or with the RFID reader.
<BR><BR>[0009]The RFID system and method according to the present invention may
     include a transponder which may be embodied in a fob, tag, card or any
     other form factor (e.g., wristwatch, keychain, cell phone, etc.), which
     may be capable of being presented for interrogation. In that regard,
     although the transponder is described herein as embodied in a fob, the
     invention is not so limited.
<BR><BR>[0010]The system may further include a RFID reader configured to send a
     standing RFID recognition signal which may be transmitted from the RFID
     reader via radio frequency (or electromagnetic) propagation. The fob may
     be placed within proximity to the RFID reader such that the RFID signal
     may interrogate the fob and initialize fob identification procedures.
<BR><BR>[0011]In one exemplary embodiment, as a part of the identification
     process, the fob and the RFID reader may engage in mutual authentication.
     The RFID reader may identify the fob as including an authorized system
     transponder for receiving encrypted information and storing the
     information on the fob memory. Similarly, the fob, upon interrogation by
     the RFID reader, may identify the RFID reader as authorized to receive
     the encrypted and stored information. Where the RFID reader and the fob
     successfully mutually authenticate, the fob may transmit to the RFID
     reader certain information identifying the resource's performance
     tracking account or accounts to which the fob is associated. The RFID
     reader may receive the information and forward the information to
     facilitate performance tracking. In one exemplary embodiment, the RFID
     reader may forward the information to a point of interaction terminal
     (e.g., POI or computer interface) for transaction completion.
<BR><BR>[0012]In another exemplary embodiment, the fob completes tasks via a
     computer interface. The fob may be connected to the computer using a USB
     or serial interface fob account information may be transferred to the
     computer for use in tracking a resource's performance via a network
     (e.g., the Internet).
<BR><BR>[0013]In still another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a system is
     disclosed which enables the fob resource and/or a manager access to a
     resource engine, wherein the resource engine may be used to automatically
     grade, track, score, and assign resources based on resource skills and
     skill sets.
<BR><BR>[0014]These features and other advantages of the system and method, as
     well as the structure and operation of various exemplary embodiments of
     the system and method, are described below.

     Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C," published by
     John Wiley & Sons (second edition, 1996), herein incorporated by
     reference.
<BR><BR>[0033]In addition, many applications of the present invention could be
     formulated. The exemplary network disclosed herein may include any system
     for exchanging data or tracking resource performance, such as a
     distributed system, a thin cable network, an Ethernet, a token ring
     network, the internet, an intranet, an extranet, wide area network (WAN),
     local area network (LAN), satellite communications, and/or the like. It
     is noted that the network may be implemented as other types of networks,
     such as an interactive television network (ITN).
<BR><BR>[0034]The system user/resource may interact with the system via any input
     device such as, a keypad, keyboard, mouse, kiosk, personal digital
     assistant, handheld computer (e.g., Palm Pilot.RTM., Blueberry.RTM.),
     cellular phone and/or the like. Similarly, the invention could be used in
     conjunction with any type of personal computer, network computer, work
     station, minicomputer, mainframe, or the like running any operating
     system such as any version of Windows, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows
     98, Windows 95, MacOS, OS/2, BeOS, Linux, UNIX, Solaris or the like.
     Moreover, although the invention may frequently be described as being
     implemented with TCP/IP communications protocol, it should be understood
     that the invention could also be implemented using SNA, IPX, Appletalk,
     IPte, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of communications protocols. Moreover,
     the system contemplates, the use, sale, or distribution of any goods,
     services or information over any network having similar functionality
     described herein.
<BR><BR>[0035]FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary RFID performance tracking
     transaction system 100A in accordance with the present invention, wherein
     exemplary components for use in completing a fob transaction are
     depicted. In general, the operation of system 100A may begin when a fob
     102 is presented for tracking a resource's performance, and is
     interrogated by an RFID reader 104 or, alternatively, a computer
     interface (e.g., user interface) 134. Fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may
     then engage in mutual authentication after which the transponder 114 may
     provide the transponder identification and/or account identifier to RFID
     reader 104 which may further provide the information to a resource engine
     130 via a point of interaction terminal 110. For further information
     related to tracking and optimizing resources, see, for example, U.S.
     patent application Ser. No. 10/770,684 filed Feb. 3, 2004, and entitled
     "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION", which is hereby
     incorporated by reference.
<BR><BR>[0036]As used herein, a resource may include any user, person, employee,
     employer, officer, entity, manager, business, client, corporation,
     customer, contractor, administrator, operator, equipment, supply,
     package, machinery, hardware and/or software. Employer, as used herein,
     may include any performance tracking entity, manager, controller,
     administrator, operator and/or company.
<BR><BR>[0037]The term tracking as used herein, may include any management,
     assignment, grading, scoring, manipulation, tracking, control,
     allocation, and/or any other modification to application information,
     resource information, skills information, and/or task information. Tasks
     may include shipments, assignments, problem tickets, enhancements,
     analyses, builds, designs, components, assemblies, and/or any other
     projects.
<BR><BR>[0038]Resource engine 130 may be a stand-alone system or incorporated into
     any pre-existing network or metrics system via any software and/or
     hardware customization or upgrades. Resource engine 130 may include any
     hardware and/or software discussed herein. Resource engine 130 may
     include a host server or other computing systems including a processor
     for processing digital data, a memory coupled to said processor for
     storing digital data, an input digitizer coupled to the processor for
     inputting digital data, an application program stored in said memory and
     accessible by said processor for directing processing of digital data by
     said processor, a display coupled to the processor and memory for
     displaying information derived from digital data processed by said
     processor and a plurality of databases, said databases including resource
     data, application data, skill data, category data and/or like data that
     could be used in association with the present invention. As those skilled
     in the art will appreciate, resource engine 130 computer will typically
     include an operating system (e.g., Windows NT, 95/98/2000, Linux,
     Solaris, etc.) as well as various conventional support software and
     drivers typically associated with computers.
<BR><BR>[0039]Resource engine 130 may also be used in conjunction with any
     monitoring system, hardware or software, configured to monitor, manage
     and track systems within resource engine 130. One example of such
     monitoring system is an off-the-shelf program such as IBM's Tivoli
     NetView.RTM., which automatically detects problems and responds to those
     problems at a local level. For example, NetView may detect a problem with
     an application and generate an information management record (IMR) in
     conjunction with that problem. The IMR from the monitoring system may
     then be transmitted to resource engine 130 through any of the
     communications networks described herein.
<BR><BR>[0040]Similarly, resource engine 130 may include, or be used in
     conjunction with, any type of personal computer, network computer,
     workstation, minicomputer, mainframe, or the like running any operating
     system such as any version of Windows, Windows NT, Windows2000, Windows
     98, Windows 95, MacOS, OS/2, BeOS, Linux, UNIX, Solaris or the like.
     Moreover, the invention may be implemented using TCP/IP communications
     protocols, IPX, Appletalk, IP-6, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of existing
     or future protocols. Resource engine 130 will be discussed in greater
     detail herein.
<BR><BR>[0041]System 100A may include fob 102 having a transponder 114 and RFID
     reader 104 in RF communication with fob 102. Although the present
     invention is described with respect to fob 102, the invention is not to
     be so limited. Indeed, system 100A may include any device having a
     transponder which is configured to communicate with RFID reader 104 via
     RF communication. Typical devices may include, for example, a key ring,
     tag, card, cell phone, wristwatch or any such form capable of being
     presented for interrogation.
<BR><BR>[0042]RFID reader 104 may be configured to communicate using an RFID
     internal antenna 106. Alternatively, RFID reader 104 may include an
     external antenna 108 for communications with fob 102, where the external
     antenna may be made remote to RFID reader 104 using a suitable cable
     and/or data link 120. RFID reader 104 may be further in communication
     with resource engine 130 via a data link 122. System 100A may include a
     transaction completion system including a point of interaction device
     such as, for example, employer point of interaction terminal 110 or
     computer 134. In one exemplary embodiment the transaction completion
     system may include resource engine 130 and/or point of interaction
     terminal 110 in communication with RFID reader 104 (via data link 122).
     As described more fully below, the transaction completion system may
     include computer 134 connected to a network 136 and to transponder 114
     via a USB connector 132.
<BR><BR>[0043]Although the point of interaction (PO) is described herein with
     respect to a resource POI terminal, the invention is not to be so
     limited. Indeed, a POI terminal is used herein by way of example, and the
     POI may be any device capable of receiving fob account data. In this
     regard, the POT may be any point of interaction device and/or terminal
     enabling the resource to complete a performance tracking transaction
     using fob 102. POI terminal 110 may be in further communication with a
     user interface 118 (via data link 128) for providing a resource and/or
     manager access to resource engine 130 information. In addition, POI
     terminal 110 may be in communication with an employer host network 112
     (via data link 124) for processing any tracking request. In this
     arrangement, information provided by RFID reader 104 is provided to POI
     terminal 110 of resource engine 130 via data link 122. POI terminal 110
     may receive the information (and alternatively may receive any identity
     verifying information from user interface 118 via data link 128) and
     provide the information to host network 112 for processing.
<BR><BR>[0044]A variety of conventional communications media and protocols may be
     used for data links 120, 122, 124, and 128 as well as for any other
     communication links mentioned herein. For example, data links 120, 122,
     124, and 128 may be an Internet Service Provider (ISP) configured to
     facilitate communications over a local loop as is typically used in
     connection with standard modem communication, cable modem, dish networks,
     ISDN, Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL), or any wireless communication
     media. In addition, resource engine 130, including POI terminal 110 and
     host network 112, may reside on a local area network which interfaces to
     a remote network (not shown) for remote authorization of an intended
     performance tracking transaction. Host network 112 may be an employer
     network, such as an employer LAN, WAN and/or intranet. Resource engine
     130 may communicate with the remote network via a leased line, such as a
     T1, D3 line, or the like. Such communications lines are described in a
     variety of texts, such as, "Understanding Data Communications," by
     Gilbert Held, which is incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0045]A transponder and/or account identifier, as used herein, may include
     any number or identifier for an account (e.g., any device, code, or other
     identifier/indicia suitably configured to allow a resource to interact or
     communicate with system 100A, such as, for example, authorization/access
     code, personal identification number (PIN), Internet code, digital
     certificate, biometric data, and/or other identification indicia). A
     transponder identifier may be further coordinated with fob 102 as well as
     a resource identifier. For example, a resource may have a resource
     account identifier associated with him. The resource may also carry fob
     102, which can only be used by that specific resource. Fob 102, in turn
     has a unique transponder identifier such that the transponder identifier
     may be associated with both the specific fob 102 and the resource holding
     fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0046]Resource engine 130 may also have one or more employer account
     identifiers associated with it. An employer account identifier may be
     used by an employer to associate a resource and/or fob 102 with a
     specific employer account. For example, the employer account identifiers
     may be used to track a resource's performance on different tasks
     associated with the employer accounts.
<BR><BR>[0047]The transponder identifier may be maintained by a performance
     tracking provider (e.g., employer) and which may be used to track a
     resource's performance. A typical transponder identifier (e.g., account
     data) may be correlated to a resource number, identifier, etc. For ease
     in understanding, the present invention may be described with respect to
     a resource ID. However, it should be noted that the invention is not so
     limited and other accounts permitting an exchange of information for an
     account data value is contemplated to be within the scope of the present
     invention.
<BR><BR>[0048]The transponder identifier may be distributed and stored in any form
     of plastic, electronic, magnetic, and/or optical device capable of
     transmitting or downloading data to a second device. A resource account
     identifier may be, for example, a resource's ten-digit social security
     number. The resource account identifier may also be, for example, the
     number of the resource's company credit card. In one exemplary
     embodiment, the transponder and/or resource account identifier may
     include a unique fob serial number and resource identification number, as
     well as specific application applets. The transponder and/or resource
     account identifiers may be stored in fob 102 inside a database 214, as
     described more fully below. Database 214 may be configured to store
     multiple account identifiers issued to fob 102 resources by the same or
     different account providing institutions.
<BR><BR>[0049]FIG. 2 illustrates the many functions of exemplary fob 102 in
     accordance with the present invention. Fob 102 may be an RFID fob which
     may be presented by the resource to facilitate an exchange of
     information, for tracking a resource's performance on one or more tasks.
     As described herein, by way of example, fob 102 may be an RFID fob which
     may be presented for facilitating tracking resource performance.
<BR><BR>[0050]Fob 102 may include an antenna 202 for receiving an interrogation
     signal from RFID reader 104 via antenna 106 (or alternatively, via
     external antenna 108). Fob antenna 202 may be in communication with
     transponder 114. In one exemplary embodiment, transponder 114 may be a
     13.56 MHz transponder compliant with the ISO/IEC 14443 standard, and
     antenna 202 may be of the 13 MHz variety. The transponder 114 may be in
     communication with a transponder compatible modulator/demodulator 206
     configured to receive the signal from transponder 114 and configured to
     modulate the signal into a format readable by any later connected
     circuitry. Further, modulator/demodulator 206 may be configured to format
     (e.g., demodulate) a signal received from the later connected circuitry
     in a format compatible with transponder 114 for transmitting to RFID
     reader 104 via antenna 202. For example, where transponder 114 is of the
     13.56 MHz variety, modulator/demodulator 206 may be ISO/IEC 14443-2
     compliant.
<BR><BR>[0051]Modulator/demodulator 206 may be coupled to a protocol/sequence
     controller 208 for facilitating control of the authentication of the
     signal provided by RFID reader 104, and for facilitating control of the
     sending of fob 102 transponder identifier. In this regard,
     protocol/sequence controller 208 may be any suitable digital or logic
     driven circuitry capable of facilitating determination of the sequence of
     operation for fob 102 inner-circuitry. For example, protocol/sequence
     controller 208 may be configured to determine whether the signal provided
     by RFID reader 104 is authenticated, and thereby providing to RFID reader
     104 the account identifier stored on fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0052]Protocol/sequence controller 208 may be further in communication
     with authentication circuitry 210 for facilitating authentication of the
     signal provided by RFID reader 104. Authentication circuitry may be
     further in communication with a non-volatile secure memory database 212.
     Secure memory database 212 may be any suitable elementary file system
     such as that defined by ISO/TEC 7816-4 or any other elementary file
     system allowing a lookup of data to be interpreted by the application on
     the chip.
<BR><BR>[0053]The data may be used by protocol/sequence controller 208 for data
     analysis and used for management and control purposes, as well as
     security purposes. Authentication circuitry may authenticate the signal
     provided by RFID reader 104 by association of the RFID signal to
     authentication keys stored on database 212. Encryption circuitry may use
     keys stored on database 212 to perform encryption and/or decryption of
     signals sent to or from RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0054]In addition, protocol/sequence controller 208 may be in
     communication with a database 214 for storing at least fob 102
     transponder account data, and a unique fob 102 identification code.
     Protocol/sequence controller 208 may be configured to retrieve the
     account identifier from database 214 as desired. Database 214 may be of
     the same configuration as database 212 described above. The fob
     transponder account data and/or unique fob identification code stored on
     database 214 may be encrypted prior to storage. Thus, where
     protocol/sequence controller 208 retrieves the account data, and or
     unique fob identification code from database 214, the transponder account
     identifier may be encrypted when being provided to RFID reader 104.
     Further, the data stored on database 214 may include, for example, an
     unencrypted unique fob 102 identification code, a resource
     identification, Track 1 and 2 data, as well as specific application
     applets.
<BR><BR>[0055]Database 212 and any other database discussed herein may be any type
     of database, such as relational, hierarchical, graphical,
     object-oriented, and/or other database configurations. Common database
     products that may be used to implement the databases include DB2 by IBM
     (White Plains, N.Y.), various database products available from Oracle
     Corporation (Redwood Shores, Calif.), Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL
     Server by Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.), or any other suitable
     database product. Moreover, the databases may be organized in any
     suitable manner, for example, as data tables or lookup tables. Each
     record may be a single file, a series of files, a linked series of data
     fields or any other data structure. Association of certain data may be
     accomplished through any desired data association technique such as those
     known or practiced in the art. For example, the association may be
     accomplished either manually or automatically. Automatic association
     techniques may include, for example, a database search, a database merge,
     GREP, AGREP, SQL, and/or the like. The association step may be
     accomplished by a database merge function, for example, using a "key
     field" in pre-selected databases or data sectors.
<BR><BR>[0056]More particularly, a "key field" partitions the database according
     to the high-level class of objects defined by the key field. For example,
     certain types of data may be designated as a key field in a plurality of
     related data tables and the data tables may then be linked on the basis
     of the type of data in the key field. In this regard, the data
     corresponding to the key field in each of the linked data tables may be
     preferably the same or of the same type. However, data tables having
     similar, though not identical, data in the key fields may also be linked
     by using AGREP, for example. In accordance with one aspect of the present
     invention, any suitable data storage technique may be utilized to store
     data without a standard format. Data sets may be stored using any
     suitable technique for example, storing individual files using an ISO/IEC
     7816-4 file structure, implementing a domain whereby a dedicated file may
     be selected that exposes one or more elementary files containing one or
     more data sets; using data sets stored in individual files using a
     hierarchical filing system; data sets stored as records in a single file
     (for example, compression, SQL accessible, hashed via one or more keys,
     numeric, alphabetical by first tuple, etc.); block of binary (BLOB);
     stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO/IEC 7816-6 data
     elements; stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO/IEC
     Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) as in ISO/IEC 8824 and 8825; and/or
     other proprietary techniques that may include fractal compression
     methods, image compression methods, etc.
<BR><BR>[0057]In one exemplary embodiment, the ability to store a wide variety of
     information in different formats may be facilitated by storing the
     information as a Block of Binary (BLOB). Thus, any binary information may
     be stored in a storage space associated with a data set. The BLOB method
     may store data sets as ungrouped data elements formatted as a block of
     binary via a fixed memory offset using either fixed storage allocation,
     circular queue techniques, or best practices with respect to memory
     management (e.g., paged memory least recently used, etc.). By using BLOB
     methods, the ability to store various data sets that have different
     formats facilitates the storage of data associated with a wide variety of
     system components by multiple and unrelated owners of the data sets. For
     example, a first data set which may be stored may be provided by a first
     issuer, a second data set which may be stored may be provided by an
     unrelated second issuer, and yet a third data set which may be stored,
     may be provided by a third issuer unrelated to the first and second
     issuer. Each of these three exemplary data sets may contain different
     information that may be stored using different data storage formats
     and/or techniques. Further, each data set may contain subsets of data
     which also may be distinct from other subsets.
<BR><BR>[0058]As stated above, in various embodiments of the present invention,
     the data may be stored without regard to a common format. However, in one
     exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the data set (e.g., BLOB)
     may be annotated in a standard manner when provided for manipulating the
     data onto the network. The annotation may comprise a short header,
     trailer, or other appropriate indicator related to each data set that may
     be configured to convey information useful in managing the various data
     sets. For example, the annotation may be called a "condition header,"
     "header," "trailer," or "status," herein, and may comprise an indication
     of the status of the data set or may include an identifier correlated to
     a specific issuer or owner of the data. In one example, the first three
     bytes of each data set BLOB may be configured or configurable to indicate
     the status of that particular data set (e.g. LOADED, INITIALIZED, READY,
     BLOCKED, REMOVABLE, or DELETED). Subsequent bytes of data may be used to
     indicate for example, the identity of the resource, user, account
     identifier or the like. Each of these condition annotations are further
     discussed herein.
<BR><BR>[0059]With reference again to the exemplary block diagrams illustrated in
     FIGS. 1 and 2, fob 102 may be configured to respond to multiple
     interrogation frequency transmissions provided by RFID reader 104. That
     is, as described more fully below, RFID reader 104 may provide more than
     one RF interrogation signal. In this case, fob 102 may be configured to
     respond to the multiple frequencies by including in fob 102 one or more
     additional RF signal receiving/transmitting units 226. RF signal
     receiving transmitting unit 226 may include an antenna 218 and
     transponder 220 where antenna 218 and transponder 220 are compatible with
     at least one of the additional RF signals provided by RFID reader 104.
     For example, in one exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may include a 134 KHz
     antenna 218 configured to communicate with a 134 KHz transponder 220. In
     this exemplary configuration, an ISO/IEC 14443-2 compliant
     modulator/demodulator may not be required. Instead, the 134 KHz
     transponder may be configured to communicate directly with the
     protocol/sequence controller 208 for transmission and receipt of
     authentication and account identifier signals as described above.
<BR><BR>[0060]In another embodiment, fob 102 may further include a universal
     serial bus (USB) connector 132 for interfacing fob 102 to user interface
     134. User interface 134 may be further in communication with POI terminal
     110 via a network 136. Network 136 may be the Internet, an intranet, or
     the like as is described above with respect to network 112. Further, user
     interface 134 may be similar in construction to any conventional input
     devices and/or computing systems aforementioned for permitting a resource
     to interact with network 136 and/or resource engine 130 through user
     interface 134. In one exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may be configured to
     facilitate online performance tracking. A USB converter 222 may be in
     communication with a USB connector 232 for facilitating the transfer of
     information between the modulator/demodulator 206 and USB connector 132.
     Alternatively, USB converter 222 may be in communication with
     protocol/sequence controller 208 to facilitate the transfer of
     information between protocol/sequence controller 208 and USB connector
     132.
<BR><BR>[0061]Where fob 102 includes USB connector 132, fob 102 may be in
     communication with, for example, a USB port on user interface 134. The
     information retrieved from fob 102 may be compatible with employee badge
     and/or smart card technology enabling usage of interactive applications
     on the Internet. No RFID reader may be required in this embodiment since
     the connection to POI terminal 110 may be made using a USB port on user
     interface 134 and network 136.
<BR><BR>[0062]Fob 102 may include means for enabling activation of the fob by the
     resource. In one exemplary embodiment, a switch 230 may be operated by
     the user/resource of fob 102. Switch 230 on fob 102 may be used to
     selectively or inclusively activate fob 102 for particular uses. In this
     context, the term "selectively" may mean that switch 230 enables the
     resource to place fob 102 in a particular operational mode. For example,
     the resource may place fob 102 in a mode for enabling tracking the
     resource's performance of a specific task using a selected task number.
     Alternatively, the fob may be placed in a mode as such that the fob
     account identifier is provided by USB port 132 (or serial port) only and
     fob transponder 114 is disabled. In addition, the term "inclusively" may
     mean that fob 102 is placed in an operational mode permitting fob 102 to
     be responsive to the RF interrogation and interrogation via the USB
     connector 132. In one particular embodiment, switch 230 may remain in an
     OFF position ensuring that one or more applications or accounts
     associated with fob 102 are non-reactive to any commands issued by RFID
     reader 104. As used herein, the OFF position may be termed the "normal"
     position of the activation switch 230, although other normal positions
     are contemplated.
<BR><BR>[0063]In another exemplary embodiment, when switch 230 is moved from the
     OFF position, fob 102 may be deemed activated by the resource. That is,
     switch 230 may activate internal circuitry in fob 102 for permitting the
     fob to be responsive to RF signals (e.g., commands from RFID reader 104).
     In this way, switch 230 may facilitate control of the active and inactive
     states of fob 102. Such control increases the system security by
     preventing inadvertent or illegal use of fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0064]In one exemplary embodiment, switch 230 may be a simple mechanical
     device in communication with circuitry which may electrically prevent the
     fob from being powered by a RFID reader. That is, when switch 230 is in
     its normal position, switch 230 may provide a short to fob 102 internal
     circuitry, preventing fob 102 from being responsive to interrogation by
     RF or via the USB connector 230). In this arrangement, switch 230 may be,
     for example, a "normally closed" (NC) configured switch, which may be
     electrically connected to antenna 202 at the interface of antenna 202 and
     transponder 114. Switch 230 may be depressed, which may open switch 230
     fully activating antenna 202.
<BR><BR>[0065]In yet another exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may include a biometric
     sensor and biometric membrane configured to operate as switch 230 and
     activate fob 102 when provided with a biometric signal from a authorized
     resource using fob 102. Such biometric signal may be the digital reading
     of a fingerprint, thumbprint, or the like. Typically, where biometric
     circuitry is used, the biometric circuitry may be powered by an internal
     voltage source (e.g., battery). In this case, the switch may not be a
     simple mechanical device, but a switch which is powered. In yet another
     exemplary embodiment, switch 230 may be battery powered though no
     biometric circuitry is present in fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0066]In yet another embodiment, switch 230 may be a logic switch. Where
     switch 230 is a logic switch, switch 230 control software may be read
     from the sequence controller 208 to selectively control the activation of
     the various fob 102 components.
<BR><BR>[0067]FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of RFID reader 104 in
     accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. RFID
     reader 104 includes, for example, an antenna 106 coupled to a RF module
     302, which is further coupled to a control module 304. In addition, RFID
     reader 104 may include antenna 108 positioned remotely from RFID reader
     104 and coupled to RFID reader 104 via a suitable cable 120, or other
     wire or wireless connection.
<BR><BR>[0068]RF module 302 and antenna 106 may be suitably configured to
     facilitate communication with fob 102. Where fob 102 is formatted to
     receive a signal at a particular RF frequency, RF module 302 may be
     configured to provide an interrogation signal at that same frequency. For
     example, in one exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may be configured to
     respond to an interrogation signal of about 13.56 MHz. In this case, RFID
     antenna 106 may be 13 MHz and may be configured to transmit an
     interrogation signal of about 13.56 MHz. That is, fob 102 may be
     configured to include a first and second RF module (e.g., transponder)
     where the first module may operate using a 134 kHz frequency and the
     second RF module may operate using a 13.56 MHz frequency. RFID reader 104
     may include two receivers which may operate using the 134 kHz frequency,
     the 13.56 MHz frequency or both. When RFID reader 104 is operating at 134
     kHz frequency, only operation with the 134 kHz module on fob 102 may be
     possible. When reader 104 is operating at the 13.56 MHz frequency, only
     operation with the 13.56 MHz module on fob 102 may be possible. Where
     RFID reader 104 supports both a 134 kHz frequency and a 13.56 MHz RF
     module, fob 102 may receive both signals from RFID reader 104. In this
     case, fob 102 may be configured to prioritize selection of the one or the
     other frequency and reject the remaining frequency. Alternatively, RFID
     reader 104 may receive signals at both frequencies from the fob upon
     interrogation. In this case, RFID reader 104 may be configured to
     prioritize selection of one or the other frequency and reject the
     remaining frequency.
<BR><BR>[0069]Further, a protocol/sequence controller 314 may include an optional
     feedback function for notifying the resource of the status of a
     particular performance tracking transaction. For example, the optional
     feedback may be in the form of an LED, LED screen and/or other visual
     display which is configured to light up or display a static, scrolling,
     flashing and/or other message and/or signal to inform a resource using
     fob 102 that a performance tracking transaction is initiated (e.g., fob
     is being interrogated), the fob is valid (e.g., fob is authenticated), a
     performance tracking transaction is being processed, (e.g., fob
     transponder account identifier is being read by RFID reader) and/or the
     transaction is accepted or denied (e.g., account identifiers approved or
     disapproved). Such an optional feedback may or may not be accompanied by
     an audible indicator (or may present the audible indicator singly) for
     informing fob 102 resource of the performance tracking transaction
     status. The audible feedback may be a simple tone, multiple tones,
     musical indicator, and/or voice indicator configured to signify when the
     fob 102 is being interrogated, the performance tracking transaction
     status, or the like.
<BR><BR>[0070]RFID antenna 106 may be in communication with a transponder 306 for
     transmitting an interrogation signal and receiving at least one of an
     authentication request signal and/or an account data from fob 102.
     Transponder 306 may be of similar description as transponder 114 of FIG.
     2. In particular, transponder 306 may be configured to send and/or
     receive RF signals in a format compatible with antenna 106 in similar
     manner as was described with respect to fob transponder 114. For example,
     where transponder 306 is 13.56 MHz RF rated antenna 106 may be 13.56 MHz
     compatible. Similarly, where transponder 306 is ISO/IEC 14443 rated,
     antenna 106 may be ISO/IEC 14443 compatible.
<BR><BR>[0071]RF module 302 may include, for example, transponder 306 in
     communication with authentication circuitry 308 which may be in
     communication with a secure database 310. Authentication circuitry 308
     and database 310 may be of similar description and operation as described
     with respect to authentication circuitry 210 and secure memory database
     212 of FIG. 2. For example, database 310 may store data corresponding to
     fob 102 which may be used to authorize the tracking of resource
     performance over system 100. Database 310 may additionally store RFID
     reader 104 identifying information and/or provide such information to fob
     102 for use in authenticating whether RFID reader 104 is authorized to be
     provided the fob transponder account identifier stored on fob database
     214.
<BR><BR>[0072]Authentication circuitry 308 may be of similar description and
     operation as authentication circuitry 210. That is, authentication
     circuitry 308 may be configured to authenticate the signal provided by
     fob 102 in a similar manner that authentication circuitry 210 may be
     configured to authenticate the signal provided by RFID reader 104. As is
     described more fully below, fob 102 and RFID reader 104 engage in mutual
     authentication. In this context, "mutual authentication" may mean that
     operation of the system 100 may not take place until fob 102
     authenticates the signal from RFID reader 104, and RFID reader 104
     authenticates the signal from fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0073]FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary authentication process in
     accordance with the present invention. The authentication process is
     depicted as one-sided. That is, the flowchart depicts the process of RFID
     reader 104 authenticating fob 102, although similar steps may be followed
     in the instance that fob 102 authenticates RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0074]As noted, database 212 may store security keys for encrypting or
     decrypting signals received from RFID reader 104. In an exemplary
     authentication process, where RFID reader 104 is authenticating fob 102,
     RFID reader 104 may provide an interrogation signal to fob 102 (step
     402). The interrogation signal may include a random code generated by the
     RFID reader authentication circuit 210, which is provided to fob 102 and
     which is encrypted using an unique encryption key corresponding to the
     unique fob 102 identification code. For example, protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may provide a command to activate the authentication
     circuitry 308. Authentication circuitry 308 may provide from database 310
     a fob interrogation signal including a random number as a part of the
     authentication code generated for each authentication signal. The
     authentication code may be an alphanumeric code which is recognizable
     (e.g., readable) by RFID reader 104 and fob 102. The authentication code
     may be provided to fob 102 via the RFID RF interface 306 and antenna 106
     (or alternatively antenna 108).
<BR><BR>[0075]Fob 102 receives the interrogation signal (step 404). The
     interrogation signal including the authorization code may be received at
     RF interface 114 via antenna 202. Once fob 102 is activated, the
     interrogation signal including the authorization code may be provided to
     the modulator/demodulator circuit 206 where the signal may be demodulated
     prior to providing the signal to protocol/sequence controller 208.
     Protocol/sequence controller 208 may recognize the interrogation signal
     as a request for authentication of fob 102, and provide the
     authentication code to authentication circuit 210. The fob 102 may then
     encrypt the authentication code (step 406). In particular, encryption may
     be done by authentication circuit 210, which may receive the
     authentication code and encrypt the code prior to providing the encrypted
     authentication code to protocol/sequence controller 208. Fob 102 may then
     provide the encrypted authentication code to RFID reader 104 (step 408).
     That is, the encrypted authentication code may be provided to RFID reader
     104 via modulator/demodulator circuit 206. RF interface 114 (e.g.,
     transponder 114) and antenna 106.
<BR><BR>[0076]RFID reader 104 may then receive the encrypted authentication code
     and decryption it (step 410). That is, the encrypted authentication code
     may be received at antenna 106 and RF interface 306 and may be provided
     to authentication circuit 308. Authentication circuit 308 may be provided
     a security authentication key (e.g., transponder system decryption key)
     from database 310. The authentication circuit may use the authentication
     key to decrypt (e.g., unlock) the encrypted authorization code. The
     authentication key may be provided to the authentication circuit based on
     the unique fob 102 identification code. For example, the encrypted
     authentication code may be provided along with the unique fob 102
     identification code. The authentication circuit may receive the unique
     fob 102 identification code and retrieve from database 310 a transponder
     system decryption key correlative to the unique fob 102 identification
     code for use in decrypting the encrypted authentication code.
<BR><BR>[0077]Once the authentication code is decrypted, the decrypted
     authentication code is compared to the authentication code provided by
     RFID reader 104 at step 402 (step 412) to verify its authenticity. If the
     decrypted authorization code is not readable (e.g., recognizable) by the
     authentication circuit 308, fob 102 is deemed to be unauthorized (e.g.,
     unverified) (step 418) and the operation of system 100 is terminated
     (step 420). Contrarily, if the decrypted authorization code is
     recognizable (e.g., verified) by fob 102, the decrypted authorization
     code is deemed to be authenticated (step 414), and the transaction is
     allowed to proceed (step 416). In one particular embodiment, the
     proceeding transaction may mean that fob 102 may authenticate RFID reader
     104 prior to RFID reader 104 authenticating fob 102, although, it should
     be apparent that RFID reader 104 may authenticate fob 102 prior to fob
     102 authenticating RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0078]It should be noted that in an exemplary verification process,
     authorization circuit 308 may determine whether the unlocked
     authorization code is identical to the authorization code provided in
     step 402. If the codes are not identical then fob 102 is not authorized
     to access system 100. Although, the verification process is described
     with respect to identicality, identicality is not required. For example,
     authentication circuit 308 may verify the decrypted code through any
     protocol, steps, or process for determining whether the decrypted code
     corresponds to authorized fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0079]Authentication circuitry 308 may additionally be in communication
     with protocol/sequence controller 314 of similar operation and
     description as protocol/sequence controller 208 of FIG. 2. That is,
     protocol/sequence device controller 314 may be configured to determine
     the order of operation of RFID reader 104 components. For example, FIG. 5
     illustrates an exemplary decision process under which protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may operate. Protocol/sequence controller 314 may command
     the different components of RFID reader 104 based on whether fob 102 is
     present (step 502). For example, if fob 102 is not present, then
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may command RFID reader 104 to provide
     an uninterrupted interrogation signal (step 504). That is,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may command authentication circuit 308
     to provide an uninterrupted interrogation signal until the presence of
     fob 102 is realized. If fob 102 is present, the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command RFID reader 104 to authenticate fob 102 (step
     506).
<BR><BR>[0080]As noted above, authentication may mean that protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command authentication circuit 308 to provide fob 102
     with an authorization code. If a response is received from fob 102,
     protocol/sequence controller may determine if the response is a response
     to RFID reader 104 provided authentication code, or if the response is a
     signal requiring authentication (step 508). If the signal requires
     <B><I>authentication, then protocol</I></B>/sequence controller 314 may activate the
     authentication circuit as described above (step 506). On the other hand,
     if fob 102 signal is a response to the provided authentication code, then
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may command RFID reader 104 to retrieve
     the appropriate security key for enabling recognition of the signal (step
     510). That is, protocol/sequence controller 314 may command
     authentication circuit 308 to retrieve from database 310 a security key
     (e.g., transponder system decryption key), unlock the signal, and compare
     the signal to the signal provided by RFID reader 104 in the
     authentication process (e.g., step 506). If the signal is recognized,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may determine that fob 102 is authorized
     to access system 100. If the signal is not recognized, then fob 102 is
     considered not authorized. In which case, protocol/sequence controller
     314 may command the RFID controller to interrogate for authorized fobs
     (step 504).
<BR><BR>[0081]Once protocol/sequence controller 314 determines that fob 102 is
     authorized, protocol/sequence controller 314 may seek to determine if
     additional signals are being sent by fob 102 (step 514). If no additional
     signal is provided by fob 102, then protocol/sequence controller 314 may
     provide all the components of RFID reader 104 to remain idle until such
     time as a signal is provided (step 516). Contrarily, where an additional
     fob 102 signal is provided, protocol/sequence controller 314 may
     determine if fob 102 is requesting access to resource engine 130 POI
     terminal 110 or if fob 102 is attempting to interrogate RFID reader 104
     for return (e.g., mutual) authorization (step 518). Where fob 102 is
     requesting access to resource engine 130 POI terminal 110,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may command RFID reader 104 to open
     communications with POI terminal 110 (step 524). In particular,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may command POI terminal communications
     interface 312 to become active, permitting transfer of data between RFID
     reader 104 and resource engine 130 POI terminal 110.
<BR><BR>[0082]On the other hand, if protocol/sequence controller determines that
     fob 102 signal is a mutual interrogation signal, then protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command RFID reader 104 to encrypt the signal (step
     520). Protocol/sequence controller 314 may command encryption
     authentication circuit 318 to retrieve from database 320 the appropriate
     encryption key in response to fob 102 mutual interrogation signal.
     Protocol/sequence controller 314 may then command RFID reader 104 to
     provide the encrypted mutual interrogation signal to fob 102.
     Protocol/sequence controller 314 may command authentication circuit 318
     to provide an encrypted mutual interrogation signal for fob 102 to
     mutually authenticate. Fob 102 may then receive the encrypted mutual
     interrogation signal and retrieve from authentication circuitry 212 a
     RFID reader decryption key.
<BR><BR>[0083]Although an exemplary decision process of protocol/sequence
     controller 314 is described, it should be understood that a similar
     decision process may be undertaken by protocol/sequence controller 208 in
     controlling the components of fob 102. Indeed, as described above,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may have similar operation and design as
     protocol/sequence controller 208. In addition, to the above,
     protocol/sequence controllers 208 and 314 may incorporate in the decision
     process appropriate commands for enabling USB interfaces 222 and 316,
     when the corresponding device is so connected.
<BR><BR>[0084]Encryption/decryption component 318 may be further in communication
     with a secure account identifier database 320 which stores the security
     keys necessary for decrypting the encrypted fob account identifier. Upon
     appropriate request from protocol/sequence controller 314,
     encryption/decryption component (e.g., circuitry 318) may retrieve the
     appropriate security key, decrypt the fob account identifier and forward
     the decrypted account identifier to protocol/sequence controller 314 in
     any format readable by any later connected POI terminal 110. In one
     exemplary embodiment, the account identifier may be forwarded in a
     conventional magnetic stripe card format compatible with the ISO/IEC 7813
     standard. That is, in accordance with the invention, there is no need to
     translate or correlate the account identifier to traditional magnetic
     stripe format as is done with the prior art. The invention processes the
     performance tracking transaction request directly, as if the card
     associated with the account has been presented for performance tracking.
<BR><BR>[0085]Upon receiving the account identifier in magnetic stripe format,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may forward the account identifier to
     POI terminal 110 via communications interface 312 and data link 122, as
     best shown in FIG. 1. Performance tracking terminal 110 may receive the
     decrypted account identifier and forward the magnetic stripe formatted
     account identifier to host network 112 for processing under the
     employer's business as usual standard. In this way, the present invention
     eliminates the need of a third-party server. Further, where POI terminal
     110 receives a response from host network 112 (e.g., performance tracking
     authorized or denied), protocol/sequence controller 314 may provide the
     network response to RF module 302 for optically and/or audibly
     communicating the response to fob 102 resource.
<BR><BR>[0086]RFID reader 104 may additionally include USB interface 316, in
     communication with the protocol/sequence controller 314. In one
     embodiment, the USB interface may be a RS22 serial data interface.
     Alternatively, RFID reader 104 may include a serial interface such as,
     for example, a RS232 interface in communication with protocol/sequence
     controller 314. USB connector 316 may be in communication with a
     personalization system 116 (shown in FIG. 1B) for initializing RFID
     reader 104 to system 100 application parameters. That is, prior to
     operation of system 100, RFID reader 104 may be in communication with
     personalization system 116 for populating database 310 with a listing of
     security keys belonging to authorized fobs 102, and for populating
     database 320 with the security keys to decrypt fob 102 account
     identifiers placing the account identifiers in ISO/IEC 7813 format. In
     this way, RFID reader 104 may be populated with a unique identifier
     (e.g., serial number) which may be used by fob authentication circuitry
     210 to determine if RFID reader 104 is authorized to receive fob 102
     encrypted account identifier.
<BR><BR>[0087]FIG. 1B illustrates an exemplary personalization system 100B, in
     accordance with the present invention. In general, typical
     personalization system 100B may be any system for initializing RFID
     reader 104 and fob 102 for use in system 100A. With reference to FIG. 1B,
     the similar personalization process for fob 102 may be illustrated. For
     example, personalization system 116 may be in communication with fob 102
     via RF ISO 14443 interface 114 for populating fob database 212 with the
     security keys for facilitating authentication of the unique RFID reader
     104 identifier. In addition, personalization system 116 may populate on
     database 212 a unique fob 102 identifier for use by RFID reader 104 in
     determining whether fob 102 is authorized to access system 100.
     Personalization system 116 may populate (e.g., inject) the encrypted fob
     102 account identifier into fob database 214 for later providing to an
     authenticated RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0088]In one exemplary embodiment, personalization system 116 may include
     any standard computing system as described above. For example,
     personalization system 116 may include a standard personal computer
     containing a hardware security module operable using any conventional
     graphic user interface. Prior to populating the security key information
     account identifier and unique identifying information into fob 102 or
     RFID reader 104, the hardware security module may authenticate fob 102
     and RFID reader 104 to verify that the components are authorized to
     receive the secure information.
<BR><BR>[0089]In another exemplary embodiment, resource engine 130 may be
     configured to facilitate implementing the functions of personalization
     system 116. For example, resource engine 130 may be configured as
     personalization system 116. Thus resource engine 130 may be in
     communication with fob 102 via RF ISO 14443 interface 114 for populating
     fob database 212 with the security keys for facilitating authentication
     of the unique RFID reader 104 identifier. In addition, resource engine
     130 may populate on database 212 a unique fob 102 identifier for use by
     RFID reader 104 in determining whether fob 102 is authorized to access
     system 100. Resource engine 130 may further populate (e.g., inject) the
     encrypted fob 102 account identifier into fob database 214 for later
     providing to an authenticated RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0090]FIGS. 6A-B illustrate an exemplary flowchart of a personalization
     procedure which may be used to personalize fob 102 and/or RFID reader
     104. Although the following description discusses mainly personalization
     of fob 102, RFID reader 104 may be personalized using a similar process.
     The personalization process, which occurs between personalization system
     116 and the device to be personalized (e.g., fob 102 or RFID reader 104),
     may begin, for example at step 602. Mutual authentication may occur
     between personalization system 116 and the device to be authenticated in
     much the same manner as was described above with regard to fob 102
     mutually authenticating with RFID reader 104. That is, personalization
     system 116 may transmit a personalization system 116 identifier to the
     device to be authenticated which is compared by the device authentication
     circuitry 210, 308 against personalization system identifiers stored in
     the device database 212, 310. Where a match does not occur (step 604),
     the personalization process may be aborted (step 612). Where a match
     occurs (step 604), personalization system 116 may prepare a
     personalization file to be provided to the device to be personalized
     (step 606). If personalization system 116 is operated manually, the
     personalization file may be entered into personalization system 116 using
     any suitable system interface such as, for example, a keyboard (step
     606). Where personalization system 116 operator elects to delay the
     preparation of the personalization files, personalization system 116 may
     abort the personalization process (step 610). In this context, the
     personalization file may include the unique fob 102 or RFID reader 104
     identifier, security key for loading into database 212 and 310, and/or
     security keys for decrypting a fob transponder account identifier which
     may be loaded in database 320.
<BR><BR>[0091]Fob 102 may be personalized by direct connection to personalization
     system 116 via RF ISO/IEC 14443 interface 114, or fob 102 may be
     personalized using RFID reader 104. Personalization system 116 and RFID
     reader 104 may engage in mutual authentication and RFID reader 104 may be
     configured to transmit the fob personalization file to fob 102 via RF.
     Once fob 102 is presented to RFID reader 104 (steps 608, 614) for
     personalization, fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may engage in mutual
     authentication (step 614). Where fob 102 is not presented to RFID reader
     104 for personalization, the personalization process may be terminated
     (step 610).
<BR><BR>[0092]If fob 102 is detected, personalization system 116 may create as a
     part of the personalization file, a unique identifier for providing to
     fob 102 (step 616). The identifier is unique in that one identifier may
     be given only to a single fob. That is, no other fob may have that same
     identifier. Fob 102 may then be configured and loaded with that
     identifier (step 618).
<BR><BR>[0093]The encrypted fob 102 transponder account identifier may be
     populated into fob 102 in the same manner as is described with respect to
     the unique fob 102 identifier. That is, personalization system 116 may
     pre-encrypt the account data (step 620) and inject the encrypted account
     into fob database 214 (step 622). The encrypted account data may be
     loaded (e.g., injected) into fob 102 using RFID reader 104 as discussed
     above.
<BR><BR>[0094]Once the personalization file is populated into fob 102, the
     populated information is irreversibly locked to prevent alteration,
     unauthorized reading and/or unauthorized access (step 624).
     Personalization system 116 may then create a log of the personalization
     file information for later access and analysis by the personalization
     system 116 resource (step 626).
<BR><BR>[0095]It should be noted that in the event the personalization process is
     compromised or interrupted (step 628), personalization system 116 may
     send a security alert to the resource (step 630) and the personalization
     process may be aborted (step 612). On the other hand, where no such
     compromising or interruption exists, personalization system 116 may be
     prepared to begin initialization on a second device to be personalized
     (step 632).
<BR><BR>[0096]FIGS. 7A-B illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a
     personalization process which may be used to personalize RFID reader 104.
     RFID reader 104 may be in communication with personalization system 116
     via RFID reader USB connection 316 (step 702). Once connected,
     personalization system 116 may establish communications with RFID reader
     104 and RFID reader 104 may provide personalization system 116 any RFID
     reader 104 identification data presently stored on RFID reader 104 (step
     704). In accordance with step 708, where RFID reader 104 is being
     personalized for the first time (step 706), RFID reader 104 and
     personalization system 116 may engage in mutual authentication as
     described above with respect to FIGS. 6A-B. After the mutual
     authentication is complete, personalization system 116 may verify that
     RFID reader 104 is properly manufactured or configured to operate within
     system 100. The verification may include evaluating the operation of RFID
     reader 104 by determining if the RFID reader will accept predetermined
     default settings. That is, personalization system 116 may then provide
     RFID reader 104 a set of default settings (step 708) and determine if
     RFID reader 104 accepts those settings (step 712). If RFID reader 104
     does not accept the default settings, personalization system 116 may
     abort the personalization process (step 714).
<BR><BR>[0097]If the personalization system 116 determines that the
     personalization process is not the first personalization process
     undertaken by RFID reader 104 (step 706), personalization system 116 and
     RFID reader 104 may engage in a mutual authentication process using the
     existing security keys already stored on RFID reader 104 (step 710). If
     authentication is unsuccessful (step 712), personalization system 116 may
     abort the personalization process (step 714).
<BR><BR>[0098]Where personalization system 116 and RFID reader 104 successfully
     mutually authenticate, personalization system 116 may update RFID reader
     104 security keys (step 716). Updating the security keys may take place
     at any time as determined by a system 100 manager. The updating may take
     place as part of a routine maintenance or merely to install current
     security key data. The updating may be performed by downloading firmware
     into RFID reader 104 (step 718). In the event that personalization system
     116 determines in step 706 that RFID reader 104 is undergoing an initial
     personalization, the firmware may be loaded into RFID reader 104 for the
     first time. In this context, "firmware" may include any file which
     enables the RFID reader 102 to operate under system 100 guidelines. For
     example, such guidelines may be directed toward the operation of RFID
     reader protocol/sequence controller 314.
<BR><BR>[0099]Personalization system 116 may then determine if the personalization
     keys (e.g., security keys, decryption keys, RFID identifier) need to be
     updated or if RFID reader 104 needs to have an initial installation of
     the personalization keys (step 720). If so, then personalization system
     116 may download the personalization keys as appropriate (step 722).
<BR><BR>[0100]Personalization system 116 may then check RFID reader 104 to
     determine if fob 102 identifiers and corresponding security keys should
     be updated or initially loaded (step 724). If no updating is necessary
     personalization system 116 may end the personalization procedure (step
     732). Contrarily, if personalization system 116 determines that fob 102
     identifiers and corresponding keys need to be updated or installed,
     personalization system 116 may download the information onto RFID reader
     104 (step 726). The information (e.g., fob security keys and identifiers)
     may be downloaded in an encrypted format and RFID reader 104 may store
     the information in RFID reader database 310 as appropriate (step 728).
     Personalization system 116 may then create or update a status log
     cataloging for later use and analysis by personalization system 116
     resource (step 730). Upon updating the status log, the personalization
     process may be terminated (step 732).
<BR><BR>[0101]It should be noted that, in some instances it may be necessary to
     repersonalize the RFID reader in similar manner as described above. In
     that instance, the personalization process described in FIGS. 7A and 7B
     may be repeated.
<BR><BR>[0102]FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for the operation of
     system 100A. The operation may be understood with reference to FIG. 1A,
     which depicts the elements of system 100A which may be used in an
     exemplary transaction. The process is initiated when a resource desires
     to present fob 102 for performance tracking (step 802). Upon presentation
     of fob 102, the employer initiates the RF performance tracking
     transaction via RFID reader 104 (step 804). In particular. RFID reader
     104 sends out an interrogation signal to scan for the presence of fob 102
     (step 806). The RF signal may be provided via RFID reader antenna 106 or
     optionally via external antenna 108. The resource then may present fob
     102 for performance tracking (step 808) and fob 102 is activated by the
     RF interrogation signal provided.
<BR><BR>[0103]Fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may then engage in mutual authentication
     (step 810). Where the mutual authentication is unsuccessful, an error
     message may be provided to the resource via the RFID optical and/or
     audible indicator (step 814) and the performance tracking transaction may
     be aborted (step 816). Where the mutual authentication is successful
     (step 814), a performance tracking request will be initiated. That is,
     RFID reader 104 may provide the resource with an appropriate optical
     and/or audible message (e.g., "performance tracking processing" or
     "wait") (step 818). Fob protocol/sequence controller 208 may then
     retrieve from database 214 an encrypted fob account identifier and
     provide the encrypted account identifier to RFID reader 104 (step 820).
<BR><BR>[0104]RFID reader 104 may then decrypt the account identifier and convert
     the account identifier into magnetic stripe (ISO/IEC 7813) format (step
     822) and provide the unencrypted account identifier to resource engine
     130 (step 824). In particular, the account identifier may be provided to
     POI terminal 110 for transmission to host network 112 for processing
     (step 828). Processing performance tracking sill be discussed in greater
     detail herein. Upon processing, POI terminal 110 may then send an optical
     and/or audible performance tracking status message to RFID reader 104
     (step 830) for communication to the resource (step 832). Once the
     resource receives the status message, the transaction is completed (step
     834.)
<BR><BR>[0105]Processing performance tracking may be achieved by several methods.
     For example, in accordance with another aspect of the present invention,
     and with reference to FIG. 10, a resource 1002 may access resource engine
     130 through user interface 118 to facilitate performance tracking, such
     as management, assignment, grading and/or scoring of resources, tasks,
     and/or applications.
<BR><BR>[0106]More particularly, in one embodiment illustrated in FIG. 11,
     resource engine 130 may comprise a variety of subprograms and/or
     databases that facilitate managing, tracking, grading, and assigning
     resources, applications, skills, and tasks. Resource engine 130 may
     interface with various subprograms or databases, wherein the subprograms
     may be part of host network 112 and/or network 136. One skilled in the
     art will appreciate that resource engine 130 may additionally interface
     with components directly, through a LAN network or indirectly via any
     other system or network.
<BR><BR>[0107]The databases comprising resource engine 130 may be managed by an
     administrative resource 1160. Administrative resource may be an
     individual, software, and/or hardware configured to facilitate
     management, control, organization and/or oversight of resource engine
     130. Additionally, there may be one or more parameters 1170 governing
     resource engine 130. Parameters 1170 may include, for example, security
     features, software requirements, hardware requirements, coding protocols
     and/or other requirements or preferences.
<BR><BR>[0108]The databases comprising resource engine 130 may be interconnected
     such that information from one database may be accessed by one, two,
     three or more other databases. By the term "access," the databases may
     transmit, receive, obtain, link, connect, associate, interface, share,
     route, acquire, ascertain, retrieve, and gain information from one
     database to another. Thus, any information updated, received and/or sent
     to one database such as, for example, resource database 1130, may be
     automatically updated throughout all or any portion of the other
     databases that are accessed by resource database 1130.
<BR><BR>[0109]For example, a resource database 1130 may access a master resource
     calendar 1180 for scheduling all resources. Master resource calendar 1180
     may additionally access resource application calendar 1182 to access
     calendar and schedule information relating to the applications to which
     resource 1130 may be assigned. Resource database 1130 may also access a
     resource schedule 1132 for scheduling that specific resource.
     Additionally, resource database 1130 may access a resource skills
     database 1134 comprising information relating to the various skills of
     resource 1130. Resource database 1130 may access a resource application
     database 1154 comprising information relating to the application that
     resource 1130 is assigned to support. Further, resource database 1130 may
     access a resource application category 1136 comprising information
     relating to specific category subset of an application that a resource is
     assigned to support. Finally, resource database 1130 may access a manager
     database 1110 comprising information on managers and the portfolios for
     which the managers are responsible.
<BR><BR>[0110]With further reference to an exemplary embodiment depicted in FIG.
     2, application 1150 may also interface with a plurality of databases. For
     example, a manager privilege class 1112 database may access application
     1150 to obtain information regarding the queues of problem tickets
     assigned to various managers 1110. Resource applications 1154 may also
     access application 1150 in order to provide resource 1130 updates,
     changes and/or other information to application 1150. Application 1150
     may further be accessed and divided into various sub-application
     categories 1152. Application categories 1152 may be further accessed by
     application category skills 1142 in order to determine what skills 1140
     are needed to support application category 1152. Application categories
     1152 may also be accessed by resource application categories 1136 in
     order to link resources 1130 to applications 1150.
<BR><BR>[0111]With further reference to an exemplary embodiment illustrated in
     FIG. 11, task databases 1120 may also interface with a plurality of
     databases. For example, task 1120 may access resource application
     category 1136. Additionally, task 1120 may access an IMR database 1122,
     which may provide information on specific tasks associated with an IMR.
     Further, task 1120 may access databases such as a task class 1128, an
     estimated time of arrival (ETA) 1126, and a task day 1124 database. Task
     class 1128 may provide information on the classification of task 1120,
     for example, whether task 1120 is a build task. ETA 1126 may provide
     estimations on task 1120 completion times based on previous task
     completion times. Task day 1124 may provide scheduling information for
     task 1120 relating to when task 1124 was assigned and/or when it is
     scheduled to be completed.
<BR><BR>[0112]While FIG. 11 illustrates a plurality of databases interfacing in a
     specific manner, any of the databases comprising resource engine 130 may
     interface to one another in any manner, and the interfaces or connections
     are not limited to those depicted. For example, task day 1124 may
     additionally access master resource calendar 1180 and/or any other
     database comprising resource engine 130.
<BR><BR>[0113]In an exemplary embodiment, the databases within resource engine
     130, as illustrated in FIG. 11, may operate in real-time. In this
     context, "real-time" includes information that may be immediately, or
     nearly immediately, accessed at the time an IMR and/or task is generated.
     For example, upon detection of an application problem, an IMR is
     generated. This IMR is then automatically broken down into applications
     and application tasks. The tasks are further automatically assigned to
     managers and/or resources based on skill and availability. As such, upon
     discovery of an IMR, resource 1102 may immediately view or manage
     resources, applications, skills, and/or tasks associated with the IMR on
     resource engine 130 via user interface 118. Resource engine 130 may also
     immediately facilitate updates to resources, applications, skills, and/or
     tasks to a network such that resource 1102 may view any manual assignment
     or management changes through user interface 118.
<BR><BR>[0114]One skilled in the art will also appreciate that resource engine 130
     may operate fully or partially in any less than real-time mode, such as,
     for example, batch processing. In an exemplary embodiment, the system may
     operate partially in real-time and partially in batch mode, wherein
     during batch mode, system information may be stored, and periodically
     updated to the network. Thus, in this embodiment, resource 1102 may
     access resource engine 130 at a later time through user interface 118 to
     manage, assign, track, score or grade resources, tasks, applications, and
     skills.
<BR><BR>[0115]The present invention may use the foregoing system components to
     perform the following method, wherein the exemplary steps discussed may
     be performed in any order. With respect to FIG. 12, resource 1102 may
     access resource engine 130 through user interface 118 (step 1201) by any
     communication method discussed herein. In one embodiment, resource 1102
     selects a web-based option for interfacing with resource engine 130 such
     that the system presents the resource 1102 with an input screen. Resource
     engine 130 may then conduct an authorization (step 1203) by any method
     discussed herein, such as, for example, by use of RFID reader 104
     communicating with POI terminal 110.
<BR><BR>[0116]Once authentication has occurred, resource engine 130 then may
     transmit a webpage and/or a resource screen for display on resource's
     1102 computer (step 1205). The webpage and/or resource screen may
     facilitate access to resource engine 130 for performance tracking of
     resources (step 1207). With reference to an exemplary screen shot
     illustrated in FIG. 13, resource screen 1300 may be configured with one
     or more toolbars 1302 and/or task bars 1304 that facilitate navigation of
     engine 130. Toolbar 1302 may be configured to be visible to resource 1102
     at all times when navigating engine 130 through user interface 118.
     Taskbar 1304 may be configured to facilitate performance tracking for the
     specific tool chosen through toolbar 1302.
<BR><BR>[0117]With continued reference to FIG. 13, resource screen 1300 may also
     be configured to facilitate resource 1102 using toolbar 1302 in selecting
     a variety of tools to be used by the present invention. These tools may
     include, for example, managing resources, IMRs, tasks, applications and
     skills through, for example, "ADMINISTRATION" 1311; viewing reports on
     resource tasks and skills, "REPORTS" 1313, automating and viewing task
     time, "TASK TIME" 1315; creating, assigning and updating tasks, "TASK
     MANAGEMENT" 1317; and/or creating resource rosters, schedules, and
     training "PLANNING" 1319. The details of these tools will be discussed
     below. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, one
     skilled in the art will appreciate that the web environment may be
     customizable and scalable, offering various other resource screen 1300
     options depending upon the particular needs of resource 1102.
<BR><BR>[0118]In accordance with the present invention, as illustrated in FIGS.
     10, 12 and 13, resource 1102 may interact with resource engine 130
     through user interface 118, using a device configured to facilitate
     interaction such as ADMINISTRATION 1311, available through resource
     screen 1300. When accessing administration information through
     ADMINISTRATION 1311, resource 1102 may be presented with a variety of
     options regarding the information accessible through taskbar 1304. These
     may include, for example, "Manage Resources," "Manage Privilege Class,"
     "Manage Application," and "Manage Skills." Each of these various
     categories may contain one or more additional links to further
     performance tracking.
<BR><BR>[0119]The various resource fields may include, for example: First Name,
     Middle Name, Last Name, Phone Number, E-mail Address, Employer, Role,
     Manager, Location, Portfolio Description, Skill, Skill Level,
     Application, Resource Percentage, Start Date, and Weekly End Date. By
     selecting "Manage Resources," resource/manager 1002 may manage resources
     within its group by selecting the link button indicating that specific
     task. By the terms "manage" and "management," resource/manager 1002 may
     add, edit, delete, save, assign, reassign, search, define, determine,
     create, and/or cancel information relating to resources within its group.
     For example resource/manager 1002 selecting the Edit button may make
     changes to various fields associated with a resource.
<BR><BR>[0120]"Manage Resources" may be configured such that the only time any of
     the Add, Edit, Delete, Save, or Cancel buttons will display is if the
     person trying to administer a resource has rights to do so. Thus, only an
     administrator, manager, manager/lead, and/or any other authorized person
     may update the Manage Resource screen. Resource engine 130 may be
     configured such that all buttons will be grayed out or un-selectable to
     resources 1002 without access rights.
<BR><BR>[0121]After an authorized resource/manager 1002 inputs changes, resource
     engine 130 may be configured to present an error message if all required
     fields are not completed. If all required fields are completed,
     information inputted into the fields may be automatically updated into
     resource engine 130.
<BR><BR>[0122]In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, fob
     resource 1002 may be provided limited access to a fob resource data file
     maintained within the "Manage Resources" area of resource engine 130 for
     managing the fob usage and fob resource 1002 information. Resource 1002
     may have access over the phone, online, or off line. Resource 1002 may
     access the fob resource data file to change, for example, demographic
     information (e.g. fob resource address, phone number, email address, or
     the like).
<BR><BR>[0123]ADMINISTRATION 1311 may additionally facilitate the management of
     privilege classes through the "Manage Privilege Class" option on task bar
     1304. Privilege classes may include designations, such as queue names,
     relating to IMRs/application failures tracked through resource engine 130
     and/or through a monitoring program, such as NetView working in
     conjunction with resource engine 130. For example, NetView may
     automatically identify and generate a problem ticket describing the root
     cause of a network failure. NetView may then transmit the problem
     ticket/IMR to a specific network failure privilege class within resource
     engine 130. Transmission of the IMR from NetView to resource engine 130
     may be through any communications means described herein.
<BR><BR>[0124]By selecting "Manage Applications," resource/manager 1002 may manage
     applications and application categories. Additionally, resource/manager
     1002 may assign/add resources to applications and/or application
     categories. Applications may be any software applications, processes,
     procedures, scripts, programs, and/or protocols running on a system. For
     example, Microsoft Word, a Service Delivery Platform application, and a
     windows application. Application categories may be any subsets of
     Applications. For example, an Application may have a Distributive
     category and a Mainframe Category. By "assign" and/or "assignment,"
     resource/manager 1002 may determine the resources to be assigned to
     applications, determine the resources to be assigned to application
     categories, define how much time a resource is assigned to an application
     or application category, determine the starting and/or ending date for an
     assignment for planning purposes, and/or track a resource's time spent on
     specific tasks, applications and/or application categories.
<BR><BR>[0125]Additionally, resource/manager 1002 may use "ADMINISTRATION" 1311 to
     facilitate the management of resource skills by selecting the "Manage
     Skills" task. "Manage Skills" may be used to facilitate managing skills
     and skill sets available and/or needed for applications and application
     categories, defining and scoring the skills and skill sets of resources,
     determining skill set levels needed for application categories, assigning
     resources to application categories based upon resource skills and/or
     skill set scores, determining skill set scores for resources assigned to
     those application categories, and redefining resource skills and/or skill
     set scores.
<BR><BR>[0126]Resource engine 130 may employ one or more algorithms to facilitate
     the management of resource skills. That is, one or more algorithms may be
     used in defining, scoring, determining, and assigning resources, skills,
     skill sets, and skill set needs. These algorithms may be automated such
     that resource engine 130 automatically tracks resources and application
     categories to continuously rescore and grade resource skills, skill set
     and application categories. Resource engine 130 may also be configured to
     allow for manual calculation, scoring, and grading of resource skills,
     skill sets and application categories for assignment and management
     purposes.
<BR><BR>[0127]Resource/manager 1002 may assign one or more skills to a specific
     category. For example, one application category (e.g. Service Delivery
     Platform services) may include multiple skills (a "skill set") to support
     it such as: Visual Basic, Microsoft SQL, exchange management skills,
     phone payment skills, information management skills, and Cobol.
     Resource/manager 1002 may additionally define "skill set" scores. For
     example, high Visual Basic, Microsoft SQL, and Cobol skills may be
     needed, while medium exchange management, and information management
     skills may be required and low phone payment skills may suffice. The
     skill set scores for the specific application category may be as follows:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00001
     Skills Skill Level Score
     Visual Basic H 80
     Microsoft SQL H 80
     exchange management M 60
     phone payment L 30
     information M 60
     management
     Cobol H 80
     Total  390
<BR><BR>[0128]The application categories skills may be further scored to determine
     the score parameters for the skill levels needed to support the category.
     For example, high skill levels would encompass scores that are 80% of 390
     and above. An example of the parameters can be viewed in the following
     table:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00002
     80% H 312
     60% M 234
     30% I 117
<BR><BR>[0129]Resource engine 130 may be used to facilitate scoring skills and/or
     skill sets of resources. By "scoring," resource/manager 1002 defines a
     resource's skills for a specific category. The score levels may be, for
     example, high, medium, or low, wherein a high score may be assigned, for
     example, 80 points, a medium score may be assigned 60 points and a low
     score may be assigned 30 points.
<BR><BR>[0130]For example, a resource's skills may be defined as follows:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00003
     Skills Skill Level Score
     Visual Basic M 60
     Microsoft SQL H 80
     exchange management L 30
     phone payment M 60
     information L 30
     management
     Cobol M 60
     Total  320
<BR><BR>[0131]The resource's skill set may then be compared to a category skill
     set to determine if the resource may be assigned to the category. This
     may be done by calculating a total resource category score based on the
     lower of the resource and task category scores. In the provided example,
     the resource's category skill score is 290. The resource therefore has
     medium-level category skills (where medium is any score from 234-311).
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00004
      Resource Category
    Resource Skill Score Category Skill Score Score
    60 80 60
    80 80 80
    30 60 30
    60 30 30
    30 60 30
    60 80 60
    Total 320 390 290
    Category Level  M
<BR><BR>[0132]Resource/manager 1002 may also use resource engine 130 to facilitate
     defining resource application portfolios. For example, resource engine
     130 may be configured to gather all the application categories for a
     resource's portfolio of applications the resource is desired to support.
     Resource engine 130 may be configured to compute scores for the
     application categories in order to determine a rating for the resource,
     where the rating may range from a G1 (the lowest) to a G5 (the highest).
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00005
    G-Rating
     G1 Greater than 0 but less than 75%
     G2 Greater than or equal to 75% but less than 90%
     G3 Greater than or equal to 90% but less than 110%
     G4 Greater than or equal to 110% but less than 125%
     G5 Greater than 125%
     G-Rating % of average standard hours
<BR><BR>[0133]For example, a resource's application portfolio may contain three
     application categories. The resource may have ten different skills, each
     skill may be scored as follows:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00006
     Skills Skill Level Score
     Skill-1 H 80
     Skill-2 M 60
     Skill-3 M 60
     Skill-4 L 30
     Skill-5 H 80
     Skill-6 H 80
     Skill-7 M 60
     Skill-8 M 60
     Skill-9 L 30
     Skill-10 M 60
<BR><BR>[0134]The three application categories in the resource's portfolio may
     have the following required skill sets:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00007
     Skills Skill Level Score
    Application Category 1
     Skill-1 M 60
     Skill-2 L 30
     Skill-3 H 80
     Skill-4 M 60
     Skill-5 L 30
     Total Score  260
     80% H 208
     60% M 156
     30% L 78
    Application Category 2
     Skill-2 M 60
     Skill-6 L 30
     Skill-7 H 80
     Total Score  170
     80% H 136
     60% M 102
     30% L 51
    Application Category 3
     Skill-3 L 30
     Skill-4 H 80
     Skill-7 M 60
     Skill-8 L 30
     Total Score  200
     80% H 160
     60% M 120
     30% L 60
<BR><BR>[0135]Thus, the resource will have a portfolio score as follows:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00008
    Res. Cat.  Res. Cat.  Res. Cat.
    Skills Skills Score Skills Skills Score Skills Skills Score
    80 60 60 60 60 60 60 30 30
    60 30 30 80 30 30 30 80 30
    60 80 60 60 80 60 60 60 60
    30 60 30    60 30 30
    80 30 30
    Total 210 Total 150 Total 150
    Level H Level H Level M
    Portfolio Total Score 510
<BR><BR>[0136]Resource engine 130 determines the rating of the resource based on
     the percentage of the total application category scores the resource
     scores in:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00009
    Application X
     Task Total Score
     Task -1 260
     Task -2: 170
     Task -3 200
     Total 630
     1 &lt;472.5
     2 &lt;567
     3 &lt;693
     4 &lt;787.5
     5 &gt;787.5
<BR><BR>[0137]Thus, in order to achieve a G1 rating, the resource would need a
     score of less than 472.5. However, the resource in this example would
     rate as a G2 because the resource's total portfolio score is 510, which
     is greater than the 75% range of the total category score of 630, but
     less than the 90% range.
<BR><BR>[0138]Each portfolio may have its own defined scoring based on application
     categories that make up the portfolio. The selection process may be
     chosen by a manager and/or resource engine 130 which selects specific
     application categories for all applications the manager and/or resource
     engine 130 supports or by gathering all application categories for a
     specific resource.
<BR><BR>[0139]In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, when
     hiring new hires, resource engine 130 may be configured to facilitate the
     generation of a portfolio application required for the new hire and a
     generation of a listing of skills that comprise the portfolio. Resource
     engine 130 may further be configured to facilitate grading of each skill
     based on interview answers and generating a total score and G rating for
     the potential new hire.
<BR><BR>[0140]Further, resource engine 130 may be used to determine current
     resource skill levels in order to determine hiring needs, training needs,
     equipment, software, and/or hardware upgrades, and/or other needed
     support. Resource engine 130 may employ one or more algorithms to
     facilitate a determination of current resource skill levels. That is, one
     or more algorithms may be used in generating a portfolio application for
     a potential new hire, generating a listing of skills within the
     portfolio, grading the skills based on potential new hire answers, and
     generating a total score for the potential hire. These algorithms may be
     automated such that resource engine 130 automatically generates and
     grades potential new hire portfolios and interview. Resource engine 130
     may also be configured to allow for manual generation of portfolios and
     portfolio skills and grading of potential hires.
<BR><BR>[0141]With reference again to an exemplary embodiment depicted in FIG. 13,
     "TASK TIME" tool 1313 may be accessed by resource 1102 to view
     automatically tracked time spent on different tasks. For example,
     resource 1102 may use fob 102 to communicate with RFID reader 104 when
     resource 1102 enters/leaves a work environment. Resource engine 130 may
     then calculate the total time resource 1102 was in the work environment
     by measuring the time between a first communication between fob 102 and
     RFID reader 104 and a second communication between fob 102 and RFID
     reader 104. For example, if a first communication occurs at 9:00 a.m. and
     a second communication occurs at 5:00 p.m., then the time resource 1102
     was in the work environment is eight hours. If resource 1102 enters and
     leaves a work environment multiple times throughout a reporting period
     (e.g., a day), resource engine 130 may be configured to keep a running
     tally of times corresponding to each period between entering and leaving.
<BR><BR>[0142]As used herein, the phrase work environment may include an office, a
     building, a shipping location, a computer environment, a computerized
     application, a computerized document, and/or any other work environment.
<BR><BR>[0143]Resource engine 130 may be additionally configured to calculate the
     time between communications between fob 102 and interface 134 to
     determine the time spent by resource 1102 on specific tasks. For example,
     with reference to FIG. 1A, resource 1102 may use fob 102 to automatically
     communicate with computer 134 when resource 1102 initiates use of
     computer 134. Computer 134 may be configured to log the tasks resource
     1102 performs via computer 134. Computer 134 may also be configured to
     communicate information to resource engine 130 relating to the tasks
     resource 1102 performs via computer 134. Resource engine 130 may use this
     information to facilitate tracking the performance of resource 1102.
<BR><BR>[0144]Resource engine 130 may also be configured to provide for "TASK
     MANAGEMENT" 1315 available through resource screen 1300. This tool may be
     used to facilitate management of application tasks. Tasks may include any
     project defined herein. Each task may be assigned to an application
     category and an application. Additionally, each task may have one or more
     subtasks with each subtask having a resource assigned to it. One manager
     may be assigned to each task.
<BR><BR>[0145]Tasks may be further categorized by class. For example, tasks
     generated from problem tickets may be classified as IMRs. Other classes
     may include, for example, tasks relating to assembly, meetings, training,
     bridge calls, projects, analysis, design, programming and build tasks.
<BR><BR>[0146]Resource engine 130 may also be used to facilitate the creation of
     subtasks associated with each task. For example, once an IMR is
     generated, subtask X may be the first task generated. Subtask X may
     relate to re-installing problem software. Additionally, another subtask
     for analyzing the re-installed software may be generated, subtask Y. An
     analyst resource may then review the reinstallation and determine that
     another analysis and/or installation task needs to be assigned. Resource
     engine 130 may be configured to automatically generate subtasks based on
     pre-programmed standards. For example, resource engine 130 may be
     pre-programmed to assign tasks relating to re-installation of software
     and analysis of a network whenever a network failure occurs. Resource
     engine 130 may also be configured for manual creation and/or reassignment
     of subtasks associated with each task.
<BR><BR>[0147]Resource engine 130 may also be configured to automatically reassign
     a task and/or subtask to another resource if a resolution of the IMR has
     not been accomplished within a set task time period. For example,
     resource engine 130 may first assign IMR-related tasks of re-installation
     and analysis to be completed within 10 working hours. If the IMR has not
     been completed within a certain set time, such as, for example 15 hours,
     resource engine 130 may automatically reassign the re-installation and/or
     analysis tasks. Resource engine 130 may access time entries from "TASK
     TIME" to determine whether tasks have been completed within a
     predetermined time.
<BR><BR>[0148]Resource engine 130 may also be configured to automatically generate
     a log of information relating to the resources and tasks already
     completed and/or worked on relating to the IMR. For example, if Word,
     Excel and PowerPoint have already been reinstalled successfully, resource
     engine 130 may be configured to create a log of this information before
     reassigning the task.
<BR><BR>[0149]Resource engine 130 may be configured to facilitate the grading of
     tasks as well. Tasks may also receive the same G-1 through G-5 ratings as
     resources. The ratings may be based on the actual hours taken to complete
     a task compared to a standard. The standard hours for a task may be
     defined by a lead programmer, a manager, and/or resource engine 130 using
     a model based on subjective standards for task completion times. The
     standard hours to complete a task may be based on the skill level of an
     average resource supporting an application. For resources with high
     skills, the standard hours may be 90% of the average standard hours.
     Similarly, for low skill resources, the standard hours may be 110% of the
     average standard hours.
<BR><BR>[0150]Ratings may be computed assuming the actual hours spent on a task.
     Errors may be created in labor tracking and often measuring a specific
     task may be inaccurate. However, resource engine 130 may increase
     accuracy by combining the total effort for all tasks in a specified
     window of time. The bigger the window of time and/or the more tasks that
     are being graded, the more accurate the grading score.
<BR><BR>[0151]For any chosen window, there may be the possibility of having open
     tasks and closed tasks. Resource engine 130 may be configured to grade
     only closed tasks. If a closed task falls partly within a window, it may
     be graded based on the percentage of the task within the window being
     graded. In order to determine this percentage, resource engine 130 may be
     configured to define a Factor to adjust the standard hours in the window.
     The Factor may be created as follows:
<BR><BR> Factor =   Task        Actual        hours        defined        within
          window        interval   Total        task        Actual
     ##EQU00001##
<BR><BR>[0152]Resource engine may be configured to multiply the Factor and the
     standard hours to determine the adjusted standard hours for a task. For
     example:
<BR><BR> ##STR00001##
<BR><BR>[0153]Task B has 10 actual task hours and the hours are defined within the
     window. Task B has a factor of 1 (10/10=1).
<BR><BR>[0154]Task A has 15 actual task hours, 12 hours are defined within the
     window, and 3 hours are outside of the window. Task A has a factor of 0.8
     (12/15=0.8).
<BR><BR>[0155]Resource engine 130 may also be configured to grade the efficiency
     of tasks. In order to obtain a Grading efficiency for closed tasks,
     resource engine 130 may total all the closed tasks hours within a window
     and then divide that number by the sum of all task hours within the same
     window. The following example shows a window of 100 hours with 90 closed
     hours within the window.
<BR><BR> ##STR00002##
<BR><BR>[0156]The result is a grading efficiency of 90%. Based on a grading
     efficiency of 90, the G-rating would be G3.
<BR><BR> ##STR00003##
<BR><BR>[0157]The following is an example of how a resource task may be graded by
     resource engine 130. The diagram below illustrates 10 tasks assigned to a
     resource. It shows how the tasks relate to a window defined by the
     resource start and end dates.
<BR><BR> ##STR00004##
<BR><BR>[0158]The following chart shows that tasks 1 through 9 are closed and task
     10 is still open. Resource engine 130 may use only the closed tasks for
     the grading. The total task hours equals 174 but only the closed task
     hours, equaling 166, may be used in the grading.
<BR><BR>[0159]The chart also shows that task 1 has 20 actual hours but only 16
     actual hours are inside of the window selected to grade. Resource Engine
     130 may use a factor of 0.80 ( 16/20) to obtain the adjusted standard
     hours needed to do grading. Tasks 2 through 9 are all within the window
     so their factor is equal to 1.00.

<BR><BR>[0160]The next chart shows the application category assigned to the closed
     tasks and the standard hours associated with each application category.
     Resource engine 130 may be configured to multiply the standard hours
     against the factor to arrive at the adjusted standard hours. Resource
     engine 130 may additionally be configured to add the adjusted standard
     hours for all the closed tasks in order to obtain the total standard
     hours.

<BR><BR>[0161]After resource engine 130 has determined the total standard hours,
     resource engine 130 can assign a grade and grade efficiency to the
     application category tasks. In the example herein, the resource task

<BR><BR>[0162]In accordance with an exemplary aspect of the present invention,
     resource engine 130 may be configured to facilitate assignment of tasks
     to resources. With reference to an exemplary flowchart illustrated in
     FIG. 14, a new IMR may be detected (step 1401) by resource engine 130 or
     by a software program such as NetView connected to resource engine 130.
     Resource engine 130 may then assign the IMR to an application category
     (step 1403). Resource engine 130 may use any method discussed herein for
     assigning to an application category. Resource engine 130 may then assign
     the IMR to a resource (step 1405) based upon the resource's skill. If the
     resource cannot do a task, resource engine 130 may reassign the task to a
     new resource.
<BR><BR>[0163]Resource engine 130 may also generate a new task (step 1407) at the
     same time the new IMR is detected. Resource engine 130 may then
     assign/reassign the new task (step 1409) to a resource by any method
     discussed herein for assigning tasks. If the resource cannot do a task,
     resource engine 130 may reassign the task to a new resource.
<BR><BR>[0164]Resource engine 130 may also be configured to determine whether
     scheduling allows for a resource to complete a task in a specific time
     level (step 1411). Resource engine 130 may access master calendars,
     master schedules, resource calendars, and/or resource schedules in order
     to determine optimum scheduling. If scheduling does not permit a resource
     to do a task within a time level, resource engine 130 may reassign the
     task to a new resource.
<BR><BR>[0165]Once resource engine 130 has assigned a task to a resource whose
     schedule fits the correct time period, the resource may begin working the
     task to completion (step 1413). Resource engine 130 may also track (step
     1415) the resource's work on the task to determine whether the resource
     has encountered problems with the task and needs additional help (step
     1417). If resource engine 130 determines that the resource needs
     additional help, it may reassign the task to another resource (step
     1409). If resource engine 130 determines that the resource does not need
     additional help, the resource will continue working the task to
     completion (step 1415).
<BR><BR>[0166]With reference again to FIG. 13, "PLANNING" 1317 may be accessed
     within resource engine 130 to facilitate the creation of employee
     rosters, the scheduling of meetings, training, tasks, personal time and
     projects, and the calendaring of resources, tasks and projects.
     Resource/manager 1002 may select, create, manage, add, delete, update
     and/or define resource schedule hours per work week. Additionally,
     resource engine 130 may be used to facilitate the creation of a resource
     calendar of the schedules of all resource/manager's 1002 resources.
<BR><BR>[0167]Resource/manager 1002 may also access resource engine 130 to
     facilitate the creation of a master resource calendar. A master resource
     calendar may include capacity hours, personal hours, and compensation
     hours. Capacity hours are the number of hours of planned capacity for a
     resource. For example, if a resource is scheduled to work eight hours per
     day each five-day work week, the capacity for the resource would be 40
     hours. The Capacity hours may be recomputed monthly, weekly, daily and/or
     annually. Personal hours may be vacation time, sick time, visa constraint
     time, jury duty time, and/or any other type of time off of work. Personal
     hours may vary from one resource to another. Compensation hours may
     include time a resource is allowed to take off for overtime hours
     previously worked. Resource engine 130 may be configured to compute
     available hours based upon the Capacity hours minus Personal hours and
     Compensation hours.
<BR><BR>[0168]Resource/manager 1002 may also access resource engine 130 to
     facilitate the management of a resource application calendar. A resource
     application calendar may store resource-specific information regarding
     the actual hours spent by a resource on an application, the number of
     hours planned for meetings and training, and whether a resource is
     working within its capacity. Resource engine 130 may connect the master
     resource calendar with a resource application calendar to best schedule
     resources and determine resource actualized hours.
<BR><BR>[0169]Resource engine 130 may also be configured to provide for "REPORTS"
     1319 available through resource screen 1300. This tool may be used to
     facilitate the generation of resource task and skill reports. The reports
     may be used by resource/manager 1002 to manage local and remote
     resources. For example, resource engine 130 may be used to generate
     reports on resource performance, resource capacities, resource training
     needs, resource skill sets, resource deficiencies, task performance, task
     resource needs, task skill set needs, and application performance.
     Additionally, resource/manager 1002 may use REPORTS 1319 to determine
     trends, problem areas, and efficiencies amongst resources, tasks, and
     applications. For example, resource/manager 1002 may access resource
     engine 130 to generate a report on various teams of resources to
     determine which teams work more effectively together and which teams
     under perform. Additionally, resource engine 130 may be used to
     facilitate a determination of hiring, training, and staffing needs.
<BR><BR>[0170]In another exemplary application, illustrated in an exemplary
     embodiment depicted in FIG. 9, fob 102 may be configured to include a
     biometric security system 902, security system 902 may be used to
     facilitate performance tracking. In this case, a resource operating a fob
     may be asked to provide assurance that the resource is in fact the same
     resource whose details are stored on the fob. Accordingly, the resource
     may provide such verification by placing his finger over the biometric
     sensor 904. Biometric sensor 904 may then digitize the fingerprint and
     provide the digitized fingerprint for verification as described above.
     Once verified, fob 102 may provide a tracking transaction authorized
     signal to RF transponder 202 (or alternatively to transponder 220) for
     forwarding to RFID reader 104. RFID reader 104 may then provide the
     authorized signal to POI terminal 110 in a similar manner as is done with
     convention PIN driven systems and POI terminal 110 may process the
     transaction under the employer's business as usual standard.
<BR><BR>[0171]In another exemplary application, fob 102 and/or RFID reader 104 may
     be configured to facilitate biometric authentication of performance
     tracking. For example, a human resource using fob 102 and/or RFID reader
     104 may pre-register biometric information that is unique to that human
     resource. For example, this biometric information may include one or more
     fingerprints, facial scans, retinal images, voice print, iris scans,
     and/or vascular patterns. By pre-registering, a user may set up one or
     more performance tracking accounts/tasks (e.g., programming tasks, build
     tasks, etc) associated with his biometric information. When a human
     resource desires to use fob 102 and/or RFID reader 104 to track his
     performance on a task, he may use a biometric security device, similar to
     that described herein, in association with fob 102 and/or RFID reader 104
     for authentication purposes. By authentication, the human resource's
     present biometric information may be compared to the pre-registered
     biometric information to find a match. Once a match is made, the human
     resource may be authorized to choose one or more tasks associated with
     his biometric information in order to begin performance tracking.
<BR><BR>[0172]In yet another exemplary application of the present invention, fob
     102 may be configured for use with global positioning technologies. For
     example, fob 102 may include any combination of positioning technology
     such as global position system (GPS), wireless assisted GPS, wireless
     assisted protocol (WAP) based location, geography markoff language (GML)
     based location, differential GPS, enhanced observed time difference
     (E-OTD), enhanced cell identification, and uplink time difference of
     arrival (U-TDOA) technologies. Fob 102 may be configured to communicate
     its positional information to one or more servers on network 136 and/or
     resource engine 130 to provide information based on the location of fob
     102. For example, a resource, such as a package, may be configured with a
     GPS-enabled fob 102 such that the package may be constantly tracked in
     order to monitor its delivery performance.
<BR><BR>[0173]In accordance with another exemplary application of the present
     invention, fob 102 may be used for travel, shopping and/or other
     businesses to facilitate the tracking of travel, shopping and/or other
     activities. For example, a shopper resource carrying fob 102, may enter a
     store and use fob 102 to track his progress through the store. Further,
     different aisles and/or checkpoints throughout the stores may be equipped
     with RFID readers 104 to facilitate tracking the shopper's performance.
     In a hardware store, as a further example, fob 102 may be used in
     conjunction with RFID readers 104 at the beginning and end of each aisle.
     Thus, when a shopper passes RFID reader 104, a performance tracking
     request may be initiated and recorded within resource engine 130. A
     manager and/or other user of resource engine 130 may then use this
     performance tracking data to determine which aisles the shoppers (and
     other shoppers) spend the most time in. The manager may then use this
     information to plan for scheduling employees, stocking supplies, ordering
     products, and/or any other related tasks. As yet another example, museums
     may use fobs 102 and RFID readers 104 to track wait times, viewing times,
     heavily trafficked areas and other related matters.
<BR><BR>[0174]In another embodiment of the present invention, fob 102 may be used
     on all products in a business, such as, for example, a grocery store. The
     store may have various RFID readers 104 equipped throughout, such that
     managers and/or other users may track the different products throughout
     the store for security, stocking and/or other purposes. For example, RFID
     reader 104 may be used in conjunction with one or more third-party
     merchant systems, as described more fully in U.S. patent application Ser.
     No. 10/192,488, entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PAYMENT USING RADIO
     FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION IN CONTACT AND CONTACTLESS TRANSACTIONS."
     Third-party merchant systems may include any issuer system and/or
     merchant system maintained by an entity, such as, for example a
     non-financial or financial institution, American Express.RTM., Visa.RTM.
     and/or MasterCard.RTM., etc.
<BR><BR>[0175]As an example of an exemplary aspect of the present invention in
     conjunction with the merchant system, fobs 102 and RFID reader 104 may be
     configured to eliminate the need for a clerk during checkout. Fobs 102
     and RFID reader 104 may also facilitate transaction time for shoppers.
     For example, a shopper may push his cart past RFID reader 104 and all the
     products in the cart may communicate purchasing information to RFID
     reader 104 and one or more third-party merchant system via fobs 102
     affixed to the products. A third-party merchant system may then be used
     to execute a payment transaction for the products. The shopper may then
     perform the transaction in an expedited way, as neither the ringing up of
     the products nor payment for the products may require a clerk's
     assistance. Additionally, RFID reader 104 may be configured to
     communicate product and purchasing information relating to the
     transaction to resource engine 130 for tracking purposes.
<BR><BR>[0176]While security measures exist that allow stores to monitor whether
     products have been shoplifted, these security measures must be removed
     and/or deactivated at checkout. As a further example of an exemplary
     aspect of the present invention, fobs 102 may be configured such that
     they do not require deactivation and/or removal. Instead, fobs 102 and
     RFID reader 104, used in conjunction with products, may be configured to
     communicate with one or more third-party merchants and resource engine
     130 to track the purchasing status of the products. For example, resource
     engine 130 may be configured to track whether fob 102 and RFID reader 104
     have been used to engage in a merchant transaction. Thus, if a shoplifter
     tries to leave a store without paying for a product, RFID reader 104,
     located at the exit of the store, may be configured to communicate with
     resource engine 130 in order to determine whether the product was the
     subject of a merchant transaction. If resource engine 130 indicates that
     the product was not the subject of a merchant transaction, RFID reader
     may be configured to sound an audible and/or silent alarm and/or
     communicate with an alarm system to alert the store's security personnel.
<BR><BR>[0177]The preceding detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the
     invention makes reference to the accompanying drawings, which show the
     exemplary embodiment by way of illustration. While these exemplary
     embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in
     the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other
     embodiments may be realized and that logical and mechanical changes may
     be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For
     example, the steps recited in any of the method or process claims may be
     executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented.
     Further, the present invention may be practiced using one or more
     servers, as necessary. Thus, the preceding detailed description is
     presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation, and
     the scope of the invention is defined by the preceding description, and
     with respect to the attached claims.
<BR><BR>[0178]Benefits, other advantages, and solutions to problems have been
     described above with regard to specific embodiments. However, the
     benefits, advantages, solutions to problems, and any element(s) that may
     cause any benefit, advantage, or solution to occur or become more
