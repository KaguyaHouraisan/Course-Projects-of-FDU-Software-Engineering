<P>A mobile terminal UE accesses a CN and utilizes the Internet via a base
     station Node-B. When riding an electric train, the mobile terminal UE
     receives a disembarkation notification and an embarkation notification
     from a <B><I>RFID</I></B> tag writer equipped on a train, and notifies the base station
     Node-B that the terminal is on-board the train. While on-board the train,
     the terminal accesses an in-vehicle AP by employing a WLAN, Bluetooth, or
     similar system, and the in-vehicle AP communicates with the base station
     Node-B. This configuration enables the in-vehicle AP to handle all of the
     mobile devices existing on a train in a centralized manner, thereby
     eliminating the need for each of the mobile devices to individually
     access the base station Node-B.

<BR><BR>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<BR><BR>[0001]This application is a continuation application of an international
     application No. PCT/JP2005/004926.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002]1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>[0003]The present invention relates to a telecommunication system for
     telecommunicating via an apparatus that handles radio waves, such as a
     mobile telecommunications apparatus, that goes into and comes out of a
     means for transporting a passenger and cargo (herein after referred to as
     a "vehicle"), wherein the vehicle may be a bus, airplane, vessel,
     electric train, or other transportation means.
<BR><BR>[0004]2. Description of the Related Arts
<BR><BR>[0005]In the current location registration system, congestion of a radio
     environment occurs when a plurality of mobile devices, that are traveling
     in a vehicle, carry out individual location registrations for a network
     (e.g., congestion occurs when an electric train or bus moves across
     location registration areas.)
<BR><BR>[0006]In order to avoid this congestion, when the location registration
     straddles one or more location registration areas then a plurality of
     mobile devices location registrations are grouped and consolidated into a
     single location registration. This concept is generally called Network
     Moving (NEMO).
<BR><BR>[0007]Currently, mobile devices are being created that not only function
     as telecommunication (sometimes abbreviated as "telecom" herein after)
     terminals (as per the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
     protocol for mobile telecom systems), but also has a telecom means such
     as a wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth, or Ultra WideBand (UWB). Such a
     mobile device is capable of suppressing power consumption and telecom
     costs by conveniently using a plurality of telecom systems depending on
     conditions.
<BR><BR>[0008]In order to accomplish a NEMO, it is necessary to determine whether
     a mobile device is inside a vehicle or outside of a vehicle; however, the
     conventional location registration system is not capable of
     distinguishing whether a mobile device is inside or outside of a vehicle.
     An other problem is that power consumption is the same when a mobile
     device is used outdoors as it is when it is used indoors. This is because
     conventional in-vehicle telecom means are compliant with the 3GPP.
<BR><BR>[0009]Therefore, in order to accomplish a NEMO, it is necessary to solve
     problems such as: finding a resource management method for a wireless
     network controller (RNC) for telecoms from an in-vehicle access point
     (AP), security problems when transitioning to another telecom system, a
     sanity check method between an in-vehicle AP and another telecom
     apparatus.
<BR><BR>[0010]Reference patent document 1 has disclosed a system in which a mobile
     terminal on-board a train accesses an external server and receives a
     service by way of a server equipped on a train.
<BR><BR>[0011]Patent document 1: Laid-Open Japanese Patent Application Publication
     No. 2001-222603
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0012]The object of the present invention is to provide a telecom system
     for carrying out a wireless telecom by grouping location registrations of
     a plurality of wireless telecom means, which are on-board a means for
     transporting passengers and/or cargo, thereby allowing a wireless telecom
     apparatus to be used on-board and off-board a transportation means.
<BR><BR>[0013]According to the present invention, a telecommunication system
     carries out a wireless telecommunication when transporting a passenger
     and/or cargo and allows a wireless telecommunication apparatus to embark
     onto and disembark from a vehicle. The telecommunication system
     comprises: an embarkation/disembarkation notification unit for notifying
     a wireless telecommunication unit, which carries out a wireless
     telecommunication, as to whether the wireless telecommunication unit is
     on-board or off-board a transportation means; an intra-transportation
     means access point unit, which is equipped on a means for transporting a
     passenger and/or cargo and functions as an access point dedicated to a
     wireless telecommunication unit within the means for transporting the
     passenger and/or cargo, wherein the accesses made to a telecommunication
     system by a wireless telecommunication units are centrally managed; and a
     wireless telecommunication unit for carrying out a telecommunication by
     accessing a means acting as a base for the telecommunication system if
     the wireless telecommunication unit is off-board, and by accessing an
     intra-transportation means access point unit if the wireless
     telecommunication unit is on-board.
<BR><BR>[0014]The present invention is configured such that wireless telecom
     apparatuses used by passengers on-board a vehicle are not required to
     individually access a base station; thereby eliminating the possibility
     of an increased process load on the base station when many mobile devices
     simultaneously carry out handoffs and/or changeovers. That is, it is
     configured to have an on-transportation means access point to consolidate
     telecommunications from individual passenger's wireless telecom
     apparatuses while on-board a vehicle, and then access an external
     wireless network; thereby making it possible to suppress increases in
     hardware resources and power consumption on a wireless network.

<BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>[0046]The present specification generically refers to a bus, a fuselage of
     an airplane, a body of a vessel, a vehicle in the form of an electric
     train (named "train" herein after), a vehicle in the form of an
     automobile, or a vehicle in an alternative form, as a vehicle. The
     following description assumes that a wireless network, such as a WLAN, is
     within a vehicle; however, the present invention is applicable to
     Bluetooth or other systems. The present specification is described by
     exemplifying the 3GPP as a mobile telecom system; however, the present
     invention is applicable to other mobile telecom systems that are
     compliant with other standards (i.e., specifications) and is not limited
     to those mobile telecom systems that are compliant with 3GPP.
<BR><BR>[0047]FIG. 1 is a diagram describing a configuration for a telecom system
     according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0048]The system, according to a preferred embodiment of the present
     invention, comprises: mobile devices (shown in the drawings as user
     equipment (UE)); an area in which a plurality of mobile devices can
     simultaneously move (e.g., a vehicle such as a train); a wireless IC tag
     (i.e., a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag); a wireless IC
     (integrated circuit) tag reader/writer (i.e., an RFID tag reader/writer);
     a 3GPP access point (AP); an access point of a wireless telecom system
     other than the 3GPP (e.g., WLAN and Bluetooth); a 3GPP base station
     (Node-B); a 3GPP wireless network control apparatus (RNC: Radio Network
     Controller); a 3GPP core network (CN); and a 3GPP home location register
     (HLR) equipped on the core network. The core network (CN) is connected to
     the Internet, thereby allowing mobile devices to access a server, which
     provides a service via an access point equipped on a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0049]The mobile device comprises a 3GPP telecom function and a wireless
     telecom system other than a 3GPP system (e.g., WLAN, Bluetooth, or
     similar system). Additionally, the mobile device comprises an RFID tag
     signal reception function.
<BR><BR>[0050]The vehicle is equipped with a 3GPP access point, an access point
     for a wireless telecom system other than a 3GPP (e.g., WLAN, Bluetooth,
     or similar system), and an RFID tag writer.
<BR><BR>[0051]Mobile devices use a 3GPP network comprising a Node-B, RNC, CN, or
     similar means for connecting to the Internet.
<BR><BR>[0052]The following shows an outline of a system's operation flow
     according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0053]When embarking on a vehicle, the mobile device engaged in a 3GPP
     telecom obtains an embarkation notification (including a mobile network
     ID) from a vehicle by way of the RFID tag, and transmits it to a CN. The
     CN searches the applicable vehicle, based on the mobile network ID,
     notifies the mobile device, and instructs the mobile device to change
     over to the WLAN. Having received the notification from the CN, the
     mobile device changes from a telecom system over to a WLAN, and carries
     out a telecom. In the vehicle, telecoms are carried out only in the WLAN
     instead of the 3GPP. Additionally, telecoms in a WLAN that are carried
     out by a plurality of mobile devices are consolidated into a 3GPP access
     point. When disembarking from the vehicle and arriving at a destination
     station, a mobile device obtains a disembarkation notification from the
     vehicle by way of a RFID tag, cuts off the WLAN, and changes over to the
     usual 3GPP telecom.
<BR><BR>[0054]The following is equipped in the system operation flow described
     above: a function for discerning an event when a mobile device embarks on
     a vehicle; a function on a mobile device for transmitting an embarkation
     notification to a CN; the method for a CN to judge a request for changing
     to a WLAN based on an embarkation notification; a method for transmitting
     a RNC and changeover request, an ID, and a password to a mobile device; a
     method for changing over a mobile device to the WLAN; a function for
     discerning whether a mobile device has disembarked from a vehicle; a
     function for transmitting a disembarkation notification from a mobile
     device to a CN; a method for transmitting information from a CN to a HLR
     based on the disembarkation notification; a function to establish
     telecoms for a plurality of mobile devices by using a RNC resource as
     part of the 3GPP access point; a protocol conversion function for
     establishing a telecom between a 3GPP access point within a vehicle and a
     WLAN access point; and a function for carrying out individual receptions
     for mobile devices under the control of the 3GPP access point.
<BR><BR>[0055]Function for Discerning an Event when a Mobile Device Embarks on a
     Vehicle&gt;
<BR><BR>[0056]The following describes a function for discerning an event when a
     mobile device embarks on a vehicle by using an RFID tag. The following
     shows the necessary method and an outline of the function:
<BR><BR>[0057]1. Install two RFID tag writers internally or externally to a
     vehicle, and respectively transmit an embarkation notification and a
     disembarkation notification; and
<BR><BR>[0058]2. Equip mobile devices with a receiving function using an RFID tag;
     judge embarkation to, and disembarkation from, a vehicle; create data to
     transmit to a CN; and transmit data by using a 3GPP.
<BR><BR>[0059]The following illustrates details of the functions:
<BR><BR>[0060]I. An RFID tag reader/writer installation method for implementing a
     function to discern whether there has been an embarkation to, or
     disembarkation from, a vehicle by using an RFID tag, wherein the method
     further comprises:
<BR><BR>[0061]1. A method #1 for equipping RFID tag writers in two places (one
     external and one internal to a vehicle).
<BR><BR>[0062]The outside-vehicle RFID tag writer and the inside-vehicle RFID tag
     writer operate simultaneously so that the outside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     can continuously transmit a disembarkation notification and the
     inside-vehicle RFID tag writer can continuously transmit an embarkation
     notification (including a mobile network ID).
<BR><BR>[0063]2. A method #2 for equipping RFID tag writer in two places (one
     external and one internal to a vehicle).
<BR><BR>[0064]The outside-vehicle RFID tag writer continuously transmits a
     disembarkation notification to a mobile device when a door is opened and
     the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer transmits an embarkation notification
     (including a mobile network ID) to a mobile device for a certain length
     of time when the door is closed.
<BR><BR>[0065]3. A method #1 for equipping RFID tag writers internally to, and
     externally to (e.g., on a station platform), a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0066]The on-platform RFID tag writer and inside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     operate simultaneously so that the on-platform RFID tag writer
     continuously transmits a disembarkation notification, and the
     inside-vehicle RFID tag writer continuously transmits an embarkation
     notification (including a mobile network ID).
<BR><BR>[0067]4. The method #2 of equipping RFID tag writers internally to, and
     externally to (e.g., on-a station platform), a vehicle
<BR><BR>[0068]The on-platform RFID tag writer continuously transmits a
     disembarkation notification to a mobile device when a door is opened, and
     the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer transmits an embarkation notification
     (including a mobile network ID) to a mobile device for a certain length
     of time when a door is closed.
<BR><BR>[0069]II. The following is a mobile device function for discerning when a
     mobile device embarks on a vehicle by using an RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0070]FIG. 2 is a functional block diagram of a mobile device according to
     a preferred embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0071]A reception unit 10 is a functional block for receiving a signal
     from an RFID tag writer that is equipped on a vehicle. A decoding unit 11
     is a functional block for decoding a received signal. The reception unit
     10 and decoding unit 11 constitute an RFID tag unit 12. An
     embarkation/disembarkation signal process unit 13 is a functional block
     for extracting whether a decoded signal is an embarkation notification or
     a disembarkation notification. An embarkation/disembarkation state
     retention unit 14 is a functional block for storing whether a mobile
     device is currently on-board a vehicle (including a mobile network ID) or
     off-board a vehicle. An embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit 15 is a
     functional block for judging whether a mobile device is on-board or
     off-board a vehicle based on a received embarkation (or disembarkation)
     notification and the current state.
<BR><BR>[0072]The judgment criterion is in accordance with the state changeover
     judgment table 1 described as follows:
<BR><BR>    TABLE-US-00001
    TABLE 1

     On-board Transmit the Discard the
     (WLAN) disembarkation embarkation
      notification to the CN notification
      transmission data
      creation unit
<BR><BR>[0073]A telecom device information retention unit 16 is a functional block
     for recording a mobile device's individual identifier and information on
     the telecom device supported by the mobile device. It is also possible to
     make the HLR perform a function similar to the function of recording
     information on a telecom device supported by a mobile device. If an HLR
     comprises this function, then the function of recording information on a
     telecom device is no longer necessary. A CN transmission data creation
     unit 17 is a functional block for adding telecom device information
     obtained from a telecom device information retention unit 16 to an
     embarkation notification and a mobile network ID. This information is
     transmitted from the embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit 15 and
     transmits the resultant to a telecom control unit 18. The telecom control
     unit 18 is a functional block capable of transmitting and receiving
     designated information by using the 3GPP protocol. The
     embarkation/disembarkation signal process unit 13,
     embarkation/disembarkation state retention unit 14,
     embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit 15, telecom device information
     retention unit 16, CN transmission data creation unit 17, and telecom
     control unit 18, constitute a main body unit 19.
<BR><BR>[0074]A transmission/reception unit 20 is a functional block for
     transmitting and receiving a signal from a 3GPP protocol. A 3GPP protocol
     process unit 21 is a functional block for extracting data from a
     reception signal by processing the 3GPP protocol and processing the data
     for a transmission signal. The transmission/reception unit 20, and 3GPP
     protocol process unit 21, constitutes a 3GPP unit 22. A
     transmission/reception unit 23 is a functional block for transmitting and
     receiving a signal of the WLAN protocol. A WLAN protocol process unit 24
     is a functional block for extracting data from a reception signal by
     processing a WLAN protocol, and processing data for a transmission
     signal. The transmission/reception unit 23, and WLAN protocol process
     unit 24, constitute a WLAN unit 25.
<BR><BR>[0075]Function of a Mobile Device Transmitting an Embarkation Notification
     to a CN&gt;
<BR><BR>[0076]The following describes the function of a mobile device transmitting
     an embarkation notification to a CN.
<BR><BR>[0077]The following is an outline of the function:
<BR><BR>[0078]1. A mobile device converts data, created by the CN transmission
     data creation unit, into a message in the 3GPP protocol and transmits the
     resultant to the RNC.
<BR><BR>[0079]2. The RNC receives the message transmitted from the mobile device,
     understands the contents, and transmits a request to the HLR on the CN
     side.
<BR><BR>[0080]The following are details of the function:
<BR><BR>[0081]I. FIG. 3 illustrates a data format for an embarkation notification
     that was created by the CN transmission data creation unit (which is
     located within the main body unit of a mobile device). FIG. 3 is a
     diagram exemplifying information required when a mobile device transmits
     an embarkation notification to a CN.
<BR><BR>[0082]1. An identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) for identifying an
     individual mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0083]2. Information (i.e., UE state information) for identifying the
     embarkation and disembarkation of a mobile device into or out of a
     vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0084]3. A mobile network ID (i.e., Network Moving ID) obtained from the
     vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0085]4. Information (i.e., Wireless Devices information) about a wireless
     telecom system other than 3GPP incorporated in the mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0086]II. There are two conceivable methods for converting data created by
     a CN transmission data creation unit, which is located within the main
     body unit of a mobile device, into a message in the 3GPP protocol and
     transmitting the resultant to an RNC. These two methods are as follows:
<BR><BR>[0087]1. A method for adding a new Information Element to an RRC
     Connection Request, wherein the Information Element is a message that is
     used when the mobile device transmits the resultant to the RNC.
<BR><BR>[0088]An Initial UE identity is stored in a UE Information Element of an
     existing RRC Connection Request message, and a NEMO Information Element
     is newly added as an Information Element.
<BR><BR>[0089]FIG. 4 is a diagram showing the contents of an RRC Connection
     Request message and a new Information Element to be added.
<BR><BR>[0090]The Initial UE identity, stored in a UE Information Element, is used
     as an identifier for identifying an individual mobile device. The NEMO
     information elements, which are newly added Information Element(s), are
     furnished with UE state information. UE state information is information
     for identifying the embarkation and disembarkation of a mobile device to
     a vehicle. UE state information includes a Network Moving ID, which is a
     mobile network ID obtained from a vehicle, and information on a wireless
     telecom system (Wireless Devices information), other than a 3GPP, which
     is incorporated on the mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0091]2. A method for defining a new 3GPP message and transmitting it to
     an RNC.
<BR><BR>[0092]A new message (i.e., a Network Moving Request) is created and
     includes: an identifier element (i.e., Initial UE identity) for
     identifying an individual mobile device; an element (i.e., UE state
     information) for identifying the embarkation and disembarkation of a
     mobile device on, and from, a vehicle; an element (i.e., Network Moving
     ID) of a mobile network obtained from a vehicle; and an element (i.e.,
     Wireless Devices information) of a wireless telecom system other than the
     3GPP incorporated on a mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0093]FIG. 5 is a diagram showing contents of a newly created message.
<BR><BR>[0094]A Network Moving Request is created as a new message. The message is
     furnished with NEMO information elements consisting of an Initial UE
     identity, UE state information, a Network Moving ID, and Wireless Device
     information.
<BR><BR>[0095]III. The following describes the operation flow of a function,
     wherein the RNC receives a message transmitted from a mobile device,
     understands the contents of the message and transmits the message to the
     HLR on the CN side.
<BR><BR>[0096]1. The RNC receives a message (i.e., a RRC Connection Request to
     which an Element in the above paragraph II is added, or a new message is
     defined) from a mobile device by way of a Node-B.
<BR><BR>[0097]2. The RNC refers to the contents of the message in the above
     paragraph 1, and validates that there is content in the information that
     indicates an "embarkation" (i.e., UE state information), which identifies
     a mobile device's embarkation onto and disembarkation from a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0098]3. The RNC transmits an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity),
     which is used to identify an individual mobile device, and also transmits
     the mobile network ID (i.e., Network Moving ID) that is obtained from the
     vehicle, and transmits information (i.e., Wireless Devices information)
     about a wireless telecom system (other than a 3GPP), which is
     incorporated on the mobile device, to the HLR on the CN side.
<BR><BR>[0099]Method wherein a CN Judges a Request for Changing to a WLAN Based on
     an Embarkation Notification&gt;
<BR><BR>[0100]The following describes a method for carrying out an inquiry request
     to a HLR based on an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) that
     identifies an individual mobile device, a Mobile network ID (i.e.,
     Network Moving ID) obtained from the vehicle, information (i.e., Wireless
     Devices information) about a wireless telecom system (other than a 3GPP)
     that is incorporated on a mobile device, and judging whether or not to
     change over to a WLAN.
<BR><BR>[0101]An outline of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0102]1. The CN transmits an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) for
     identifying an individual mobile device, a mobile network ID (i.e.,
     Network Moving ID), and information (i.e., Wireless Devices information)
     about a wireless telecom system (other than a 3GPP), which is
     incorporated in the mobile device and transmitted from the RNC to the
     HLR.
<BR><BR>[0103]2. The HLR compares two pieces of pre-registered information (i.e.,
     a vehicle's mobile network ID and information about a vehicle's wireless
     telecom system) with two pieces of information from a mobile device
     (i.e., the mobile network ID and the wireless telecom system), which are
     transmitted from the CN. From this information, the HLR identifies the
     vehicle and judges whether or not there is a common wireless telecom
     system between the vehicle and the mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0104]3. After judging that there is a common wireless telecom system
     between the vehicle and the mobile device, the HLR transmits a request to
     the CN to change a mobile device's connections to a common wireless
     telecom system, and uses the vehicle's AP to authenticate the
     pre-registered ID and password. The HLR also defines the assigned
     authentication-use ID, and authentication password, as "in use" and adds
     an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) to identify an individual
     mobile device. An alternative configuration may conceivably have the HLR
     request the vehicle's AP, obtain an authenticable ID and password, and
     then transmit the authenticable ID and password to the CN.
<BR><BR>[0105]4. The CN transmits the request to change the mobile device
     connection to a common wireless telecom system, and transmits a
     pre-registered ID and password from a HLR to a RNC, wherein the vehicle's
     AP can authenticate the pre-registered ID and password.
<BR><BR>[0106]The following shows details of the function described above in
     outline 2:
<BR><BR>[0107]I. The HLR compares two pieces of pre-registered information (i.e.,
     a vehicle's mobile network ID and information about a vehicle's wireless
     telecom system) with two pieces of information that are transmitted from
     the CN (i.e., a mobile device's mobile network ID and wireless telecom
     system) using the following method:
<BR><BR>[0108]1. The HLR searches a file, from a database that stores information
     about vehicle wireless telecom systems, for a vehicle that has a mobile
     network ID that is identical to the mobile network ID that was
     transmitted from the CN based on the vehicle's mobile network ID.
<BR><BR>[0109]2. The HLR compares information about a vehicle's wireless telecom
     system from a search file with information about the mobile device's
     wireless telecom system, and searches for the same wireless telecom
     system. If a plurality of wireless telecom systems are found, then a high
     priority wireless system is adopted on a pre-designated vehicle or mobile
     device. An other method for adopting a wireless system when a plurality
     of wireless telecom systems are found may conceivably include an HLR
     making an inquiry to a vehicle's AP as to the number of mobile devices
     that are connected to a plurality of applicable wireless telecom systems
     (or the amount of traffic on the systems), and adopting a wireless system
     with the fewest number of mobile devices connected to it (or the least
     amount of traffic).
<BR><BR>[0110]The following shows details of the function described above in
     outline 3:
<BR><BR>[0111]I. The following shows a function wherein an HLR searches an ID and
     a password, and an AP authenticates the applicable pre-registered
     vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0112]1. The HLR obtains a list of IDs and passwords by searching a
     database that stores vehicle mobile network IDs, and wireless telecom
     systems IDs and passwords (comprising a list distinguishing whether the
     IDs and passwords are "in use" or "not in use"). The wireless telecom
     systems IDs and passwords are possessed by a vehicle's APs by using an
     applicable vehicle's mobile network ID and the adopted wireless telecom
     system as search keys.
<BR><BR>[0113]2. The HLR selects, and adopts, an unused ID and password from a
     list of IDs and passwords of an applicable vehicle's AP. The HLR also
     defines assigned authentication-use IDs and authentication passwords as
     "in use", and adds an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) to identify
     an individual mobile device in order to use it for a later search.
<BR><BR>[0114]3. The HLR transmits the ID and password mentioned in paragraph 2
     and sends connection change request to an applicable wireless telecom
     system to the CN.
<BR><BR>[0115]FIG. 6 is a block configuration diagram of a CN's function for
     processing a new message.
<BR><BR>[0116]A CN unit 33 of a CN 39 allows a message reception unit 31 to
     receive a message from an RNC 30 and allows a message transmission unit
     32 transmit a message to the RNC 30. The message received in the message
     reception unit 31 is compared, and judged, by a HLR unit's 38
     comparison/judgment unit 34. In this event, information from a mobile
     network ID/telecom system information database unit 35 is referred to.
     The comparison/judgment unit 34 and the mobile network ID/telecom system
     information database unit 35 are configured to carry out the process
     described in the above outline (paragraph) 2. An authentication-use
     ID/authentication password control unit 36 and an authentication-use
     ID/authentication password database unit 37 are configured to carry out
     the process described in the above outline (paragraph) 3.
<BR><BR>[0117]Method for an RNC to Transmit a Changeover Request, ID, and
     Password, to a Mobile Device&gt;
<BR><BR>[0118]The following describes a method for an RNC to transmit a changeover
     request, ID, and password, to a mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0119]An outline of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0120]An RNC transmits a request to change a connection to an applicable
     wireless telecom system, which is transmitted from the CN. The RNC also
     transmits the applicable wireless telecom's ID and password to a mobile
     device by converting them into a message in accordance with a 3GPP
     protocol.
<BR><BR>[0121]The detail of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0122]I. A request by the RNC to change the connection to an applicable
     wireless telecom system is transmitted from the CN, and the applicable
     wireless telecom system's ID and password data formats are shown in FIG.
     7.
<BR><BR>[0123]FIG. 7 is a diagram showing necessary information transmitted to a
     mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0124]FIG. 7 shows the following pieces of information:
<BR><BR>[0125]1. Identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) for identifying an
     individual mobile device;
<BR><BR>[0126]2. Request (i.e., Change Connection Request) for changing a
     connection to the applicable wireless telecom system;
<BR><BR>[0127]3. Authentication-use ID (i.e., Connection ID) of the applicable
     wireless telecom system; and
<BR><BR>[0128]4. Authentication password (i.e., Connection Password) of the
     applicable wireless telecom system.
<BR><BR>[0129]II. The following is a conceivable method for an RNC to transmit a
     request, to a mobile device, to change a connection to an applicable
     wireless telecom system. This method includes transmitting the applicable
     wireless telecoms system's ID and password from the CN by converting the
     ID and password into a message that complies with the 3GPP protocol.
<BR><BR>[0130]1. A method for adding a new Information Element to an RRC
     Connection Setup, which is a message used to respond to an RRC Connection
     Request, and for transmitting the result to a mobile device when the
     mobile device issues a call.
<BR><BR>[0131]Add the Initial UE identity, stored in the UE Information Elements
     of the existing RRC Connection Setup message, and the NEMO Information
     Elements as a new Information Element.
<BR><BR>[0132]FIG. 8 is a diagram showing the contents of a RRC Connection Setup
     message and newly added information.
<BR><BR>[0133]An Initial UE identity, belonging to the UE information elements of
     the RRC Connection Setup, is used as an identifier to identify an
     individual mobile device. The NEMO information elements which are newly
     added Information Elements are furnished with a Change Connection Request
     that is a request to change a connection to an applicable wireless
     telecom system; a Connection ID (which is an authentication-use ID of the
     applicable wireless telecom system); and a Connection password (which is
     an authentication password for the applicable wireless telecom system.)
<BR><BR>[0134]2. A method for defining a new 3GPP message and transmitting it to a
     mobile device
<BR><BR>[0135]FIG. 9 is a diagram exemplifying the contents of the newly created
     message.
<BR><BR>[0136]What is created is a message (i.e., Network Moving Setup) including
     an identifier element (i.e., Initial UE identity) for identifying an
     individual mobile device, an element (i.e., Change Connection Request)
     for requesting a connection be changed to an applicable wireless telecom
     system, an element (i.e., Connection ID) of an applicable wireless
     telecom system's authentication-use ID, and an element (i.e., Connection
     Password) of an applicable wireless telecom system's authentication
     password.
<BR><BR>[0137]Method for a Mobile Device to Change to a WLAN&gt;
<BR><BR>[0138]The following details a method for a mobile device to change over to
     a WLAN.
<BR><BR>[0139]1. A mobile device allows a 3GPP unit to receive an RRC Connection
     Setup added with a new Element, or receive a newly created message (i.e.,
     Network Moving Setup).
<BR><BR>[0140]2. Based on the received message, the mobile device's telecom
     control unit discerns whether a request to change to a WLAN has been
     made, obtains a WLAN authentication-use ID and an authentication
     password, and ends the telecom in the 3GPP.
<BR><BR>[0141]3. The mobile device initiates a WLAN unit and connects to an
     in-vehicle AP by using the authentication-use ID and authentication
     password.
<BR><BR>[0142]4. Upon completion of the authentication, the mobile device
     continues telecom with the in-vehicle AP in the WLAN.
<BR><BR>[0143]FIG. 10 is a sequence between a vehicle, a mobile device, and a CN.
<BR><BR>[0144]The mobile device's telecom control unit transmits an RRC Connection
     Request to a RNC's telecom control unit, wherein a new Element is added
     to the RRC Connection Request. The RNC transmits only the Network Moving
     ID and Wireless Devices information to the CN. The CN allows the CN unit
     to receive the Network Moving ID and Wireless Devices information, and
     transmit them to the HLR unit. The HLR unit judges whether to change to a
     WLAN based on database of the Network Moving ID and the Wireless Devices
     information, obtains an authentication-use ID and an authentication
     password for the WLAN from the database, and transmits a Change
     Connection Request, Connection ID, and Connection Password to the RNC via
     the CN unit. The RNC adds an Initial UE identity to the aforementioned
     pieces of information and transmits an RRC Connection Setup message to a
     mobile device. The mobile device accesses the in-vehicle AP and receives
     a WLAN authentication by using the Connection ID and Connection Password,
     thereby enabling a WLAN telecom between the in-vehicle AP and mobile
     device.
<BR><BR>[0145]FIG. 11 is a diagram showing one example of a process for a CN
     changeover request.
<BR><BR>[0146]When the RNC 30 transmits an RRC Connection Request, the message
     reception unit 31 in the CN unit 33 receives it, and transmits only the
     Network Moving ID and Wireless Devices information to the
     comparison/judgment unit 34. The comparison/judgment unit 34 searches in
     the mobile network ID/telecom system information database unit 35, and
     judges whether to change to a WLAN based on the search result. The result
     of the judgment is transmitted to the authentication-use
     ID/authentication password control unit 36, and a request is made to the
     authentication-use ID/authentication password database unit 37 for
     obtaining an authentication-use ID and an authentication password. The
     authentication-use ID/authentication password control unit 36 transmits a
     Change Connection Request, a Connection ID, and a Connection Password to
     the message transmission unit 32 based on the obtainment result. The
     message transmission unit 32 transmits these pieces of information to the
     RNC 30 as an RRC Connection Setup.
<BR><BR>[0147]Function for Discerning Whether a Mobile Device is Disembarking from
     a Vehicle&gt;
<BR><BR>[0148]The following describes the function for discerning whether a mobile
     device is disembarking from a vehicle by employing an RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0149]An outline of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0150]1. Two RFID tag writers are equipped to a vehicle (either internally
     or externally), and an embarkation notification and a disembarkation
     notification are respectively transmitted.
<BR><BR>[0151]2. A mobile device is equipped with a receiving function using an
     RFID tag. The mobile device is also equipped with functions to judge the
     embarkation onto, or disembarkation from, a vehicle, to create data to be
     transmitted to a CN, and to transmit by employing a 3GPP.
<BR><BR>[0152]A detail of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0153]I. An RFID tag writer/reader installation method for implementing a
     function to discern whether there is an embarkation onto, or
     disembarkation from, a vehicle, is similar to the method described in the
     "function for discerning whether a mobile device is embarking on a
     vehicle", wherein four manners being conceivable.
<BR><BR>[0154]II. The function used by a mobile device to discern whether a mobile
     device is embarking on a vehicle is the same as the method described in
     the "function for discerning whether a mobile device is embarking on a
     vehicle".
<BR><BR>[0155]Function for a Mobile Device to Transmit a Disembarkation
     Notification to a CN&gt;
<BR><BR>[0156]The following describes the function of a mobile device when
     transmitting a disembarkation notification to the CN.
<BR><BR>[0157]An outline of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0158]1. The mobile device converts data, created by the CN transmission
     data creation unit, into a message in accordance with a 3GPP protocol and
     transmits the message to the RNC.
<BR><BR>[0159]2. The RNC receives the message transmitted from a mobile device,
     understands the contents, and transmits the message to a HLR on the CN
     side.
<BR><BR>[0160]A detail of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0161]I. FIG. 12 shows the data format for a disembarkation notification,
     which is created by the CN transmission data creation unit within the
     main body unit of a mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0162]FIG. 12 is a diagram showing information transmitted from a mobile
     device to a CN.
<BR><BR>[0163]FIG. 12 shows the following pieces of information:
<BR><BR>[0164]1. Identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) for identifying an
     individual mobile device;
<BR><BR>[0165]2. Information (i.e., UE state Information) for identifying the
     embarkation and disembarkation of the mobile device to the vehicle;
<BR><BR>[0166]3. Mobile network ID (i.e., Network Moving ID) obtained from the
     vehicle;
<BR><BR>[0167]II. There are two conceivable methods for converting data created by
     the CN transmission data creation unit, which is located within the main
     body unit of the mobile device, into a message in the 3GPP protocol and
     transmitting the resultant to the RNC.
<BR><BR>[0168]1. A new Information Element is added to a GMM Routing Area Update,
     which is a message used when attaching a mobile device, and is
     transmitted to the RNC.
<BR><BR>[0169]NEMO Information Elements are added, as a new Information Element,
     to the existing GMM Routing Area Update Request message.
<BR><BR>[0170]FIG. 13 is a diagram that shows the contents of a newly added
     message.
<BR><BR>[0171]The NEMO Information Elements are added to the GMM Routing Area
     Update Request. The NEMO Information Elements include Initial UE
     identity, UE state Information, and Network Moving ID.
<BR><BR>[0172]2. A new 3GPP message is transmitted to the RNC.
<BR><BR>[0173]FIG. 14 is a diagram showing the contents of a newly created
     message.
<BR><BR>[0174]A new message (i.e., Network Moving Reject) is created and includes
     an identifier element (Initial UE identity) for identifying an individual
     mobile device, an information element (UE state Information) for
     identifying whether a mobile device is embarking on or disembarking from
     a vehicle, and an element (Network Moving ID) of a mobile network ID
     obtained from a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0175]III. The following describes the flow of a RNC function that
     receives a message transmitted from a mobile device, understands the
     contents, and transmits the message to the HLR on the CN side.
<BR><BR>[0176]1. The RNC receives a message (i.e., GMM Routing Area Update Request
     to which a new element is added, as described in the above paragraph II,
     or a new message is defined) by way of the Node-B.
<BR><BR>[0177]2. The RNC refers to the contents of the message from the above
     paragraph 1, and confirms the existence of the contents by indicating
     "disembarkation" as the information element (UE state Information), which
     identifies whether the mobile device is embarking onto or disembarking
     from a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0178]3. The RNC transmits an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity),
     which is used to identify an individual mobile device (included in the
     message in paragraph 1 above) and transmits the mobile network ID (i.e.,
     Network Moving ID) obtained from the vehicle to the HLR on the CN side.
<BR><BR>[0179]Method for a CN to Transmit to an HLR Based on a Disembarkation
     Notification&gt;
<BR><BR>[0180]The following describes a method for the CN to transmit an
     identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) to the HLR, wherein the method
     identifies an individual mobile device and a mobile network ID (i.e.,
     Network Moving ID).
<BR><BR>[0181]An outline of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0182]1. The CN transmits an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity), to
     identify an individual mobile device and a mobile network ID (i.e.,
     Network Moving ID), to the HLR.
<BR><BR>[0183]2. The HLR searches the authentication-use ID and authentication
     password used by a mobile device based on two pieces of the information
     (i.e., the identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) for identifying an
     individual mobile device and a mobile network ID (i.e., Network Moving
     ID).) These two pieces of information are transmitted from the CN, and
     these two pieces of information are also registered when embarking onto a
     vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0184]3. The HLR changes the "in use" authentication-use ID and
     authentication password to "not in use", and transmits a disembarkation
     completion notification to the CN.
<BR><BR>[0185]4. The CN transmits to the RNC the disembarkation completion
     notification sent from the HLR.
<BR><BR>[0186]5. The RNC receives the disembarkation completion notification, and
     the series of processes ends.
<BR><BR>[0187]FIG. 15 is a sequence of changeover requests between the vehicle,
     mobile device, and CN.
<BR><BR>[0188]Upon completion of a WLAN's telecom with an in-vehicle AP, a mobile
     device transmits a GMM Routing Area Update Request to the RNC. The RNC
     receives a message (i.e., GMM Routing Area Update Request to which a new
     element is added as described in paragraph II above, or a new message is
     defined) transmitted from the mobile device. The RNC refers to the
     contents of the transmitted message and confirms the existence of the
     content by indicating whether "disembarkation" is included as an
     information (i.e., UE state Information) for identifying whether a mobile
     device has embarked onto or disembarked from a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0189]The RNC transmits an identifier (i.e., Initial UE identity) to
     identify an individual mobile device and a mobile network ID (i.e.,
     Network Moving ID) obtained from the vehicle, which are included in the
     transmitted message to the HLR on the CN side. The HLR unit searches the
     authentication-use ID and authentication password used by the mobile
     device, and then changes the authentication-use ID and authentication
     password to "not in use". The HLR unit transmits a disembarkation
     completion notification to the RNC by way of a CN unit. The mobile device
     starts a telecom in the 3GPP after carrying out other necessary 3GPP
     processes.
<BR><BR>[0190]FIG. 16 is a diagram showing an outline of an operation for a CN's
     changeover request process. Having received a GMM Routing Area Update
     Request from the RNC 30, the message reception unit 31 transmits the
     Initial UE identity and Network Moving ID to the authentication-use
     ID/authentication password control unit 36. The authentication-use
     ID/authentication password control unit 36 notifies the
     authentication-use ID/authentication password database unit 37 of a
     request to change the "in use" authentication-use ID and authentication
     password to "not in use". Having received the change result, the
     authentication-use ID/authentication password control unit 36 transmits a
     disembarkation completion notification to the message transmission unit
     32, which in turn transmits the disembarkation completion notification to
     the RNC 30.
<BR><BR>[0191]Method for Communicating Between an in-Vehicle AP and a Mobile
     Device&gt;
<BR><BR>[0192]The following describes a method for communicating between an
     in-vehicle AP and a mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0193]FIG. 17 is a functional block diagram of an in-vehicle AP.
<BR><BR>[0194]An outline of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0195]1. A WLAN telecom control unit 45, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     receives an authentication request from the mobile device, transmits the
     authentication-use ID and authentication password (which are transmitted
     from a mobile device to a user authentication unit 46), and carries out
     an authentication.
<BR><BR>[0196]2. If the authentication of the mobile device is a success, the
     authentication is notified by a control unit 47, which then requests that
     a 3GPP telecom control unit 48 secure a telecom resource for the
     applicable mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0197]3. If the 3GPP telecom control unit 48 succeeds in securing the
     telecom resource, the control unit 47 correlates the IP address assigned
     to the mobile device with a channel number on the 3GPP's Dedicated
     Traffic Channel (DTCH).
<BR><BR>[0198]4. The 3GPP telecom control unit 48 adds the channel number to the
     header of a data packet from the DTCH, and transmits the resultant to an
     IP address conversion unit 49 if a packet data is being transmitted, or
     to an encode/decode unit 50 if voice data is being transmitted.
<BR><BR>[0199]5. The encode/decode unit 50 converts the data part of an Adaptive
     Multi-Rate (AMR), which is the 3GPP's voice data, into Voice over
     Internet Protocol (VoIP) data and transmits the resultant to the IP
     address conversion unit 49.
<BR><BR>[0200]6. The IP address conversion unit 49 extracts a channel number from
     the data transmitted from the 3GPP telecom control unit 48, and converts
     it into a corresponding IP address. The data is then transmitted to a
     WLAN telecom control unit 45.
<BR><BR>[0201]7. If there has been a telecom end request from a mobile device (or
     if a telecom can no longer be established due to a radio wave condition
     from the mobile device), the WLAN telecom control unit 45 (which is in
     the in-vehicle AP) ends the telecom with the present mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0202]8. The in-vehicle AP's control unit 47 requests the 3GPP telecom
     control unit 48 release the mobile device's telecom resource.
<BR><BR>[0203]9. The control unit 47 erases the association between the IP
     address, which is assigned to the mobile device, and the 3GPP's DTCH
     channel number.
<BR><BR>[0204]Note that paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 above show a flow of data from the
     3GPP to the WLAN; however, a reverse flow of data can be carried out in a
     similar process.
<BR><BR>[0205]The transmission/reception unit, 3GPP protocol process unit, and
     WLAN protocol process unit, are the same as those of FIG. 2; therefore,
     their descriptions are omitted here.
<BR><BR>[0206]Also, the encode/decode unit 50 is configured to convert voice data
     between the AMR and VoIP, which is where encoding and decoding is carried
     out. The AMR and VoIP cannot be interchanged because a time delay in
     voice data is limited in the AMR, which is a 3GPP voice protocol, whereas
     a WLAN's VoIP allows for random delays.
<BR><BR>[0207]A detail of the function is as follows:
<BR><BR>[0208]I. The following is an example of an authentication method for an
     authentication-use ID, and an authentication password, that is carried
     out by the user authentication unit within an in-vehicle AP.
<BR><BR>[0209]The following describes an Extensible <B><I>Authentication Protocol</I></B> (EAP)
     authentication system employing a common WLAN and a Remote Authentication
     Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server (EAP-TTLS (Tunneled Transport Layer
     Security)).
<BR><BR>[0210]FIG. 18 is a WLAN authentication sequence between a mobile device
     and an in-vehicle AP.
<BR><BR>[0211]1. The WLAN telecom control unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     receives an Initial Request from the mobile device. (Initial Request)
<BR><BR>[0212]2. The WLAN telecom control unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     requests an authentication-use ID from the mobile device. (EAPoL ID
     Request)
<BR><BR>[0213]3. The WLAN telecom control unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     receives an authentication-use ID that is transmitted from a mobile
     device. (EAPoL ID Response)
<BR><BR>[0214]4. The WLAN telecom control unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     transmits an authentication-use ID from a mobile device to a user
     authentication unit within the in-vehicle AP. (Access Request)
<BR><BR>[0215]5. The user authentication unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     communicates with a mobile device and determines an authentication
     method. (Negotiate Method (TTLS))
<BR><BR>[0216]6. The user authentication unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     transmits an authentication-use server certificate to a mobile device.
     (Authenticate Server Certificate)
<BR><BR>[0217]7. The mobile device transmits an authentication password to a user
     authentication unit, which is within the in-vehicle AP. (Authenticate
     Client Username Password)
<BR><BR>[0218]8. The user authentication unit, located within the in-vehicle AP,
     issues a secret-key cryptographic key (i.e., Wired Equivalent Privacy
     (WEP) key) to a mobile device. (WEP key Generation)
<BR><BR>[0219]In the authentication procedure described above, the "method for an
     RNC transmitting a changeover request, ID and password to a mobile
     device" is employed by the method for a mobile device to transmit an
     authentication-use ID and authentication password. The authentication-use
     ID and authentication password are transmitted from the RNC to the mobile
     device and kept secret; therefore, a third party cannot intercept any of
     them.
<BR><BR>[0220]II. The following shows a method whereby a control unit requests
     that a 3GPP telecom control unit secure a telecom resource for an
     applicable mobile device:
<BR><BR>[0221]1. The 3GPP telecom control unit within the in-vehicle AP requests
     the RNC for adding a DTCH.
<BR><BR>[0222]2. The channel number of the added DTCH is recorded.
<BR><BR>[0223]III. The following shows a method whereby a control unit correlates
     an IP address, assigned to the mobile device, with a 3GPP DTCH channel
     number.
<BR><BR>[0224]1. The control unit, located within the in-vehicle AP, correlates a
     mobile device's IP address (which is assigned to the mobile device by a
     WLAN telecom control unit) with a DTCH channel number added in the above
     paragraph II.
<BR><BR>[0225]IV. The following shows a method whereby a 3GPP telecom control unit
     adds a channel number to the header of a DTCH data packet:
<BR><BR>[0226]1. In the case of a packet telecom, the channel number of the
     transmitted and received DTCH is added to the header part of an IP
     packet.
<BR><BR>[0227]2. In the case of voice data, the channel number of the transmitted
     and received DTCH is added to the header part of a voice packet.
<BR><BR>[0228]V. The following shows a method whereby an encode/decode unit
     converts an AMR data part, which is 3GPP voice data, into a VoIP data
     packet:
<BR><BR>[0229]1. Data compressed by an AMR codec is obtained from a 3GPP telecom
     control unit.
<BR><BR>[0230]2. An AMR decoder, located within the encode/decode unit, decodes
     the data compressed by the AMR codec.
<BR><BR>[0231]3. The decoded data is transmitted to an encode/decode unit's VoIP
     encoder and compressed to a VoIP-use data packet.
<BR><BR>[0232]4. The compressed data packet is transmitted to the IP address
     conversion unit and converted into an IP address for the applicable
     mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0233]VI. The following shows the method whereby an encode/decode unit
     converts a VoIP data packet into an AMR data part, which is voice data of
     the 3GPP:
<BR><BR>[0234]1. obtaining data compressed by a VoIP data packet from an IP
     address conversion unit.
<BR><BR>[0235]2. A VoIP decoder, located within the encode/decode unit, decodes
     the data compressed by a VoIP codec.
<BR><BR>[0236]3. The decoded data is transmitted to the encode/decode unit's AMR
     encoder and compressed to AMR-use data.
<BR><BR>[0237]4. The compressed data is transmitted to the 3GPP telecom control
     unit and converted into the 3GPP protocol.

     determining the time of embarking onto a vehicle by an RFID tag, using an
     installation method #1 of an RFID tag writer, as well as using a function
     of a mobile device when the mobile device outside of a vehicle embarks
     onto a vehicle. The following description illustrates the operation of a
     mobile device proceeding from the outside of a vehicle to the inside of
     the vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0239]FIG. 19 is an embarkation notification sequence between the vehicle,
     mobile device, and CN.
<BR><BR>[0240]1. A reception unit, located within the RFID tag of the mobile
     device, receives a disembarkation notification signal transmitted from an
     outside-vehicle RFID tag writer.
<BR><BR>[0241]2. A decoding unit, located within a RFID tag of a mobile device,
     decodes the received signal.
<BR><BR>[0242]3. An embarkation/disembarkation signal process unit, located within
     the main body unit of a mobile device, analyzes the decoded signal and
     judges whether or not a received signal is a disembarkation notification.
<BR><BR>[0243]4. An embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit, located within the
     main body unit of the mobile device, applies the disembarkation
     notification sent from the embarkation/disembarkation signal process
     unit, and the state (of disembarkation) sent from the
     embarkation/disembarkation state retention unit, to a state changeover
     judgment table. It then judges whether to discard the disembarkation
     notification.
<BR><BR>[0244]5. The reception unit, located within a mobile device's RFID tag,
     receives an embarkation notification (including a mobile network ID)
     signal transmitted from an in-vehicle RFID tag writer.

     main body unit of the mobile device, applies the embarkation notification
     sent from the embarkation/disembarkation signal process unit, and a state
     (of disembarkation) sent from the embarkation/disembarkation state
     retention unit, to a state changeover judgment table. It then judges
     whether the embarkation notification is a transmission to the CN
     transmission data creation unit, and transmits it accordingly.
<BR><BR>[0248]9. The CN transmission data creation unit, located within the main
     body unit of the mobile device, adds telecom device information obtained
     from a telecom device information retention unit to the embarkation
     notification and mobile network ID (which are received from the
     embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit) and transmits the resultant to
     the telecom control unit located within a mobile device's main body unit.
<BR><BR>[0249]10. The telecom control unit, located within a mobile device's main
     body unit, transmits the data transmitted from the CN transmission data
     creation unit to the 3GPP protocol process unit located within a mobile
     device's 3GPP unit.
<BR><BR>[0250]11. The 3GPP protocol process unit, located within a mobile device's
     3GPP unit transmits data from the telecom control unit, located within
     the main body unit of the mobile device, to the CN by way of the
     transmission/reception unit within a mobile device's 3GPP unit.
<BR><BR>[0251]II. The following shows a process for implementing a function for

     notification.
<BR><BR>[0256]4. The embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit, located within the
     main body unit of the mobile device, applies the embarkation notification
     sent from the embarkation/disembarkation signal process unit, and a state
     (of embarkation) sent from an embarkation/disembarkation state retention

     unit, and a state (of embarkation (including a mobile network ID)) sent
     from an embarkation/disembarkation state retention unit, to a state
     changeover judgment table. It then judges whether the disembarkation
     notification is a transmission to the CN transmission data creation unit,
     and transmits it accordingly.

     body unit of a mobile device, adds telecom device information obtained
     from a telecom device information retention unit to the disembarkation
     notification and mobile network ID, which are received from the
     embarkation/disembarkation judgment unit, and transmits the resultant to
     the telecom control unit (which is located within the main body unit of
     the mobile device.)
<BR><BR>[0262]10. The telecom control unit, located within the main body unit of
     the mobile device, transmits data from the CN transmission data creation
     unit to the 3GPP protocol process unit (which is located within a mobile
     device's 3GPP unit.)

     notification to the control unit.
<BR><BR>[0275]10. The control unit sends a resource addition request to the 3GPP
     telecom control unit. The 3GPP telecom control unit transmits a DTCH
     addition request to the RNC.

     main body unit's IP address conversion unit via a WLAN protocol process
     unit and an in-vehicle AP unit's WLAN telecom control unit.
<BR><BR>[0284]2. The IP address conversion unit converts the IP address of the IP
     packet, which is based on a mobile device channel conversion table, and
     transmits the IP packet to the 3GPP protocol process unit. The 3GPP
     protocol process unit transmits the IP packet to a DTCH channel that
     corresponds to the received IP packet. The IP packet is received at the
     RNC.
<BR><BR>[0285]3. When transmitting the IP packet from a RNC to a mobile device,
     the IP packet is transmitted from the RNC to an in-vehicle AP's 3GPP

<BR><BR>[0290]2. The IP address conversion unit converts the VoIP address based on
     the mobile device-channel conversion table.
<BR><BR>[0291]3. The IP packet, which includes the converted IP address, is sent
     to the encode/decode unit to decode VoIP voice data and encode it into
     AMR data.
<BR><BR>[0292]4. The generated AMR data is sent to a 3GPP protocol process unit,
     which then sends the AMR data to the RNC by using a DTCH channel.
<BR><BR>[0293]5. When sending voice data from a RNC to a mobile device, the AMR
     data is sent to the 3GPP protocol process unit and an encode/decode unit
     transmits the AMR data (which has been transmitted to a DTCH channel.)
<BR><BR>[0294]6. The encode/decode unit decodes the AMR data, encodes it to VoIP

     method and an operation for implementing a function for discerning
     whether a vehicle is being embarked on, or disembarked from, by using an
     RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0324]The following illustrates an example of data formats for a
     disembarkation notification, for data transmitted from a mobile network
     ID's RFID writer, and for a RFID tag reader/writer installation method.
<BR><BR>[0325]FIGS. 27A and 27B are diagrams illustrating a data format for an
     RFID and a data format for a mobile network ID.
<BR><BR>[0326]i. Regarding a data format for a disembarkation notification
<BR><BR>[0327]FIG. 27A exemplifies a data format for a disembarkation
     notification.
<BR><BR>[0328]Data for a disembarkation notification is composed of header
     information having a data length that is compliant with a RFID data

     of 4 bits.
<BR><BR>[0329]ii. Regarding a data format for a mobile network ID
<BR><BR>[0330]FIG. 27B exemplifies a data format for a mobile network ID.
<BR><BR>[0331]Mobile network ID data is composed of header information having a
     data length that is compliant with a RFID data format. For example, a
     Network Moving ID may have a data length of 32 bits.
<BR><BR>[0332]Configuration Example of an RFID Tag Reader/Writer Installation
     Method&gt;
<BR><BR>[0333]FIGS. 28A through 31D are diagrams exemplifying a RFID tag
     reader/writer installation method.
<BR><BR>[0334]1. FIGS. 28A through 28D refer to a method #1 for equipping RFID tag
     writers in two places, specifically on the outside, and inside, of a
     vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0335]Both the outside-vehicle RFID tag writer and the inside-vehicle RFID
     tag writer operate simultaneously. The outside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     continuously transmits a disembarkation notification and the
     inside-vehicle RFID tag writer continually transmits an embarkation
     notification (including a mobile network ID).
<BR><BR>[0336]When embarking on a vehicle, a mobile device receives a
     disembarkation notification from the outside-vehicle RFID tag writer, and
     then receives a mobile network ID from the inside-vehicle RFID tag
     writer. Having received the mobile network ID and the disembarkation
     notification, the mobile device judges whether there has been an
     embarkation onto the vehicle (refer to FIG. 28A).
<BR><BR>[0337]The mobile device transmits the obtained mobile network ID to the
     CN, receives an instruction from the CN to change to the in-vehicle AP,
     and changes the telecom system from the 3GPP protocol to a WLAN, which is
     a telecom system for the in-vehicle AP (refer to FIG. 28B).
<BR><BR>[0338]After changing over to the in-vehicle AP, the mobile device engages
     in telecommunications with the WLAN until a disembarkation notification
     is received from the RFID (refer to FIG. 28C).
<BR><BR>[0339]When disembarking from the vehicle, the mobile device receives a
     mobile network ID from the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer, and then
     receives a disembarkation notification from the outside-vehicle RFID tag
     writer. Having received the disembarkation notification and the mobile
     network ID, the mobile device judges whether the vehicle has been
     disembarked from, changes over to the 3GPP, and returns to a usual mobile
     telecom (refer to FIG. 28D).
<BR><BR>[0340]2. FIGS. 29A through 29D refer to a method #2 for equipping RFID tag
     writers in two places, specifically on the outside, and inside, of a
     vehicle. The outside-vehicle RFID tag writer continuously transmits a
     disembarkation notification when a door is being opened, and the
     inside-vehicle RFID tag writer transmits an embarkation notification
     (including a mobile network ID) for a certain length of time when a door
     is being closed.
<BR><BR>[0341]A mobile device has obtained a disembarkation notification from the
     RFID and has discarded it because it has not received an embarkation
     notification (refer to FIG. 29A).
<BR><BR>[0342]After closing the door, the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer transmits
     a mobile network ID. The mobile device obtains the mobile network ID by
     way of the RFID, transmits it to the CN, receives an instruction from the
     CN for changing to the in-vehicle AP, and accordingly changes to the
     in-vehicle AP (refer to FIG. 29B).
<BR><BR>[0343]After changing to the in-vehicle AP, the mobile device continues
     telecoms until a disembarkation notification is received from the RFID
     (refer to FIG. 29C).
<BR><BR>[0344]After closing the door, the outside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     transmits a disembarkation notification. The mobile device obtains a
     disembarkation notification from the RFID, changes to the 3GPP, and
     returns to a usual mobile telecom (refer to FIG. 29D).
<BR><BR>[0345]3. FIGS. 30A through 30D illustrate a method #1 for equipping RFID
     tag writers on the outside (e.g., on a station platform), and inside, of
     a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0346]The on-platform RFID tag writer and inside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     operate simultaneously. The on-platform RFID tag writer continuously
     transmits a disembarkation notification and the inside-vehicle RFID tag
     writer continuously transmits an embarkation notification (including a
     mobile network ID).
<BR><BR>[0347]When embarking on a vehicle, a mobile device receives a
     disembarkation notification from the RFID tag writer, which is installed
     on the platform (i.e., on the outside of a vehicle). The mobile device
     then receives a mobile network ID from the inside-vehicle RFID tag
     writer. Having received the disembarkation notification followed by the
     mobile network ID, the mobile device determines that the vehicle has been
     embarked on (refer to FIG. 30A). According to FIGS. 30A through 30D, the
     outside-vehicle RFID tag writer is installed on the platform, whereas
     FIGS. 28A through 29D include the outside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     installed in the vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0348]The mobile device transmits the obtained mobile network ID to the
     CN, receives an instruction from the CN to change access points to the
     in-vehicle AP and accordingly changes access points (refer to FIG. 30B).
<BR><BR>[0349]After changing to the in-vehicle AP, the mobile device continues the
     telecom until a disembarkation notification is received from the RFID
     (refer to FIG. 30C).
<BR><BR>[0350]When disembarking from the vehicle, the mobile device receives a
     mobile network ID from the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer, and then
     receives a disembarkation notification from an outside-vehicle RFID tag
     writer. Having received the mobile network ID followed by a
     disembarkation notification, the mobile device determines that the
     vehicle has been disembarked from, changes to the 3GPP, and returns to a
     usual mobile telecom (refer to FIG. 30D).
<BR><BR>[0351]4. FIGS. 31A through 31 D illustrate a method #2 for equipping RFID
     tag writers on the outside (e.g., on a station platform), and inside, of
     a vehicle.
<BR><BR>[0352]The on-platform RFID tag writer continuously transmits a
     disembarkation notification to the mobile device when a door is being
     opened, and the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer transmits an embarkation
     notification (including a mobile network ID) to the mobile device for a
     certain length of time when the door is being closed.
<BR><BR>[0353]The mobile device obtains a disembarkation notification from the
     RFID and discards it because an embarkation notification has not been
     received (refer to FIG. 31A).
<BR><BR>[0354]After closing the vehicle door, the inside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     transmits a mobile network ID. The mobile device obtains the mobile
     network ID via the RFID, transmits the mobile network ID to the CN,
     receives an instruction from the CN to change the access point to an
     in-vehicle AP, and accordingly changes the access point (refer to FIG.
     31B).
<BR><BR>[0355]After changing over to an in-vehicle AP, the mobile device continues
     telecoms until a disembarkation notification has been received from the
     RFID (refer to FIG. 31C).
<BR><BR>[0356]After opening the vehicle door, the outside-vehicle RFID tag writer
     transmits a disembarkation notification. The mobile device obtains the
     disembarkation notification via a RFID, changes to the 3GPP, and returns
     to a usual mobile telecom ((refer to FIG. 31D).
