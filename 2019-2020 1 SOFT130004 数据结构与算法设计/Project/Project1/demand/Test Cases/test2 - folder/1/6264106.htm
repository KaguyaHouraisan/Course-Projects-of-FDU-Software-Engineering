<BR><BR>This invention relates to bar code scanning circuits and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) circuits.  More specifically, this invention relates to providing increased functionality of circuitry in standard forms of these circuits.
<BR><BR>In the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) industry, certain form factors, i.e., specific space allocation for devices having a known functionality, have become standard.  One example of a form factor in the AIDC industry is the
conventional hand-held, pistol-shaped housing for bar code scanners.  Another example of a form factor is the module-size of a commonly used laser scan engine--e.g., the SE1200 scan engine produced by the assignee, Symbol Technologies, Inc.  of
Holtsville, N.Y.--which has established a standard form factor for laser bar code scanner circuitry modules in the AIDC industry.
<BR><BR>However, because the form factors are standard, and, therefore, the space allocated for the device is limited to a certain size and shape, the functionality of the device is limited as well.  In addition, the interfaces to and from the standard
form factors are generally fixed--e.g., a certain form factor will be limited to an eight-pin interface.
<BR><BR>Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a device which fits an accepted form factor and interface, yet adds increased functionality.
<BR><BR>It would also be desirable to provide a device that adds increased functionality, fits in an accepted form factor and which utilizes circuitry already present within the device to support the added functionality.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>It is an object of this invention to provide a device which fits an accepted form factor and interface, yet adds increased functionality.
<BR><BR>It is also an object of this invention to provide a device that adds increased functionality, fits in an accepted form factor and which utilizes circuitry already present within the device to support the added functionality.
<BR><BR>A bar code scanner/RFID circuit for use in a free-standing reader device and that provides an interrogation signal to an identification tag (e.g., either a bar code tag or an RF tag, or a combination of both), and receiving a data signal from an
identification tag, is provided.  The circuit can preferably be formed to fit accepted sizes for a laser scan engine available in the industry.  The circuit includes a first processing unit, a bar code scanner circuit, an RFID circuit, a second
processing circuit and a data acquisition circuit.
<BR><BR>The second processing circuit is coupled to receive a data acquisition command from the first processing unit, and, in response to the data acquisition command, to instruct either the bar code scanner circuit or the RFID circuit, or both, to
provide an interrogation signal to the identification tag and to receive the data signal.
<BR><BR>The data acquisition circuit is adapted to receive the data signal from either the bar code scanner circuit or the RFID circuit, to process the data signal first into an analog signal (although the data signal is already analog, it is not
suitable for digitization without additional processing) and then into a digital signal, and to transmit the digital signal to the central processing unit over a digital signal path.
<BR><BR>In one embodiment of the invention, the bar code scanner/RFID circuit may accept a data signal from each of the bar code scanner circuit and the RFID circuit simultaneously. <BR><BR>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DRAWINGS
<BR><BR>The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts
throughout, and in which:
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a first preferred embodiment of a bar code scanner/RFID circuit according to the invention; and
<BR><BR>FIG. 1A is a diagram of exemplary signals processed by the data acquisition circuits of bar code readers and RFID circuits;
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a second embodiment of a bar code scanner/RFID circuit according to the invention; and
<BR><BR>FIG. 3 is a block diagram of another embodiment of a image capture/RFID circuit. <BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A circuit for use in a free-standing device that combines certain functional elements of a bar code scanner circuit and an RFID circuit is provided.
<BR><BR>The method and/or circuitry required to produce outgoing bar code interrogation signals and to produce outgoing RFID interrogation signals share certain similarities.  In addition, the method and/or circuitry required to process incoming data
signals from either a bar code tag or an RFID tag, respectively, share certain similarities.  The similarities are as follows.
<BR><BR>First, each command to generate an outgoing bar code interrogation signal or an outgoing RFID interrogation signal may be provided by a suitable processing unit--e.g., preferably a digital microcontroller.  While it is true that the commands
received by the bar code circuit and the RFID circuit may vary in frequency or other signal characteristic, nevertheless, one processing unit is capable of commanding either circuit at various frequencies or characteristics.  Therefore, it is highly
advantageous to utilize one microcontroller to provide each of the bar code circuit and the RFID circuit with the command to generate interrogation signals.  This saves space and power as compared to a design which utilizes two microcontrollers to
provide the command to generate interrogation signals.
<BR><BR>Another similarity between the two circuits is that each of the bar code scanner circuit and the RFID circuit receive and pre-process data signals which they receive from a bar code tag or an RF tag, respectively.  Then, each of the circuits
provides a pre-processed signal to a data acquisition circuit.  The data acquisition circuit preferably includes a summing circuit or a multiplexer for receiving the data signal, a peak detector (or comparator, or other suitable circuit for determining
the length and/or magnitude of the peaks of the incoming data signal), filter components, gain components and suitable circuitry for converting the data signal into an acceptable analog signal and then into a digital signal--e.g., a digitizer or similar
analog-to-digital converter.  The digital signal can then be transmitted to the central processing unit.
<BR><BR>Following pre-processing, the respective data signals from each of the bar code circuit and the RFID circuit are substantially similar.  Therefore, further processing of the data signals into digitizable analog signals, and their respective
conversion from analog to digital signals, can be accomplished with a single data acquisition circuit.  By utilizing a single data acquisition circuit to process the data signal produced by each of the bar code circuit and the RFID circuit, a significant
reduction in circuit size and power consumption can be realized.
<BR><BR>As mentioned above, the data acquisition circuit may preferably include a summing circuit or a multiplexer, a peak detector (or other suitable circuit--e.g., a comparator) for detecting the magnitude, frequency and duration of the peak of the
data signal, filter components, gain components, and suitable circuitry for converting the analog signal into a digital signal--e.g., a digitizer or other analog to digital converter.  In addition, a single interface can be used to interface between the
bar code scan/RFID circuitry (which is preferably located in a hand-held reader or scanning device), specifically between the data acquisition circuit and the central processing unit, as opposed to two individual interfaces.  A preferable embodiment of
this interface is an eight-pin interface between the central processing unit and the bar code scan/RFID circuitry.  The eight pins are preferably reserved for the following eight functions: 1)power, 2)Automatic Gain Control, 3)laser enable 4)scan enable,
5)SOS--Start Of Scan, 6)DBP--Digital Bar Pattern, 7)digital ground and 8) analog ground.  This configuration provides for a single digital signal path to the central processing unit for both the bar code scanner and the RFID circuit while using a single
eight-pin interface.  The RFID is enable via a command from the central processing unit to the microcontroller or one of the eight unique possible combinations of 2)AGC 3)Laser Enable) or 4) Scan Enable to be decoded and interpreted by the
microcontroller.  One of these pins can also be used to "wake up" the microcontroller from sleep mode, if desired.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of one preferable embodiment of a bar code scanner/RFID circuit 100 according to the principles of the invention.
<BR><BR>When a user instructs central processing unit 108 to read an identification tag (e.g., a bar code tag, an RF tag or both), central processing unit 108 provides a data acquisition command to digital microprocessor 114 (or some other suitable
processing unit.  In one embodiment of the invention, all the tasks performed by central processing unit 108 and digital microprocessor 114 can be performed by a single processing unit).  The data acquisition command could be either to read the tag as a
bar code tag or to read it as an RF tag.  The data acquisition command could also be to read the tag as both a bar code tag and an RF tag as will be discussed below (in the embodiment where both are read, an actuator on a hand-held device containing the
present invention should preferably be provided such that the positions available to the user are bar code scan, RFID scan and simultaneous bar code/RFID setting).
<BR><BR>The bar code scanner circuit includes laser propagation device 102 and laser detection device 104, shown in dashed lines in FIG. 1.  If the data acquisition command instructs microprocessor 114 to read the tag as a bar code, microprocessor 114
then turns ON laser 112 which generates a laser beam.  Microprocessor 114 also turns ON motor drive 110 which actuates a laser scan pattern for laser 112, or of a mirror (not shown) which reflects the emitted laser beam, such that multiple laser beams,
which preferably cover the entire breadth of a bar code, can be generated by a single laser device, giving the appearance of multiple lasers.  Laser 112 may preferably incorporate a VCSEL (Vertical Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) or some other suitable
device for generating a light beam.  These laser devices are well known in the art.  Other image projection and capture devices are also possible, as will be described in detail.
<BR><BR>After the data signal--i.e., the reflected laser light--is detected by laser detection circuit 104, the signal is pre-processed by front end 138.  This may preferably be a pre-amplifier to amplify the data signal and transmit it to data
acquisition circuit 105.
<BR><BR>Microcontroller 114 is also configured to provide a command signal to RFID circuit 106.  Crystal 120 provides a clock signal to microcontroller 114 and to amplifier 112.  Amplifier 112 amplifies and processes the clock signal from crystal 120 and
provides a signal to counter 118.
<BR><BR>Microcontroller 114 also provides an RFID enable signal to counter 118 which enables the RFID circuit.  Thereafter, the counter signal is preferably filtered by bandpass filter 112, amplified by power amplifier 123 and then propagated as an RF
signal via antenna 126.  Antenna 126 then determines, either through inductive coupling, through RF propagation, or other suitable RF method, whether there is an RFID tag in the RF field propagated by antenna 126, and, if so, the characteristics of the
RFID tag.
<BR><BR>Thereafter, antenna 126 transmits a data signal based on the RF information to a bandpass filter 128.  Bandpass filter then transmits the signal to multiplier 132, which samples the signal at a rate preferably controlled by counter 118 and then
transmits the sampled signal to another bandpass filter 133 which further pre-processes the data signal and transmits it to data acquisition circuit 105.  The particular electronics for pre-processing the data signal are well-known in the art and are not
limited to the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 1.
<BR><BR>Following pre-processing, each of the data signals from laser detection circuit 104 and from RFID circuit 106 are similar enough such that a single component--e.g., element 136--can be utilized as a receiver for both signals.  Element 136 can
preferably be a summing circuit, which adds both signals and thereby utilizes only the signal being received, a multiplexer or other suitable device.
<BR><BR>Thereafter, the signal is preferably transmitted to element 140 in data acquisition circuit 105.  Element 140 can preferably be a peak detector, comparator, differentiator or other suitable device for determining the magnitude and duration of the
peaks of the incoming signal.
<BR><BR>The signal preferably is then further processed by the automatic gain control 142, the gain and filter block 144, and the digitizer 146, after which it preferably is transmitted as a suitable digital signal to central processing unit 108.  The
signal may be transmitted to central processing unit 108 by a single eight-pin interface, as described above, or other suitable single interface for transmitting digital signals.
<BR><BR>Thus, by utilizing a single microcontroller, a single data acquisition circuit and a single interface and digital signal path, a bar code scanner/RFID circuit can be substantially reduced in size.  At this reduced size, the circuit can be formed
to fit into space which is currently allocated for modules that provide only scanning capabilities--e.g., a space created to contain the aforementioned SE1200 scan engine.
<BR><BR>In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a bar code scanner/RFID circuit can be modified to simultaneously scan a bar code tag and an RFID tag.  This may prove useful, for example, if one of the identifiers, either the bar code tag or the
RFID tags, was rendered unreadable by some obstruction or other interruption.  A circuit that scans and reads simultaneously from both types of identifiers preferably would provide a redundancy whereby any interruption in either system would be overcome
by the second system (except where both systems were obstructed).  In addition, such a redundancy could provide for an added security measure by cross-confirming the results from each individual identification with the other identification.  Another
possible advantage of having simultaneous readings is the following: in one embodiment of a circuit according to the invention, a bar code could provide a key to decrypt the RFID whereby the RFID could only be deciphered with an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key found in
the bar code, or vice versa.
<BR><BR>In an another alternative embodiment, a digitizer used previously only for bar codes may be used according to the invention.  Moreover, there is an added benefit that is obtained by using a bar code digitizer to process the analog signal from the
RFID circuit.  The bar code digitizer provides greater read range performance for the RFID than conventional analog to digital conversion allows.
<BR><BR>Bar code digitizers are specially designed to handle highly blurred bar code signals.  The data can be recovered by the bar code digitizer even though the filtering process, which results from the larger laser beam spot, effectively reduces the
bandwidth of the "channel" of the recovered information.  By using a bar code digitizer for RFID, the bandwidth is artificially reduced.  However, this reduction of bandwidth, which blurs the incoming signal and causes it to appear more blurry, increases
the interrogation range.  The bar code digitizer is capable of handling this higher "blur" or lower contrast signal and will effectively compensate for the artificial channel bandwidth reduction.  Thus, using a bar code digitizer to convert RFID signals
increases the interrogation of the RFID.  Reducing the bandwidth of the RFID antenna increases the Q, and, thereby, the energy coupled to the RFID tag.  It also reduces the noise on the RFID receiver, which, in turn, improves its sensitivity to detect
weak RFID tag signals.  Weak RFID tag signals may be due to long range or a material blockage--e.g., metal or water, or a wet cardboard container.
<BR><BR>FIG. 1A shows a typical example of possible signals from bar code circuits and RFID circuits.  Code 181 is an exemplary bar code.  Analog signal 182 is an exemplary analog bar code signal.  The lack of clarity, or blur, is evident in signal 182. 
Digital signal 183 is shown after a bar code digitizer removes the blur.  RFID signal 184 is an example of a signal sent by an RFID tag.  The blurred signal 185 is an example of the RFID signal as received by a reduced bandwidth receiver.  Dotted line
186 indicates the signal received by RFID antenna with sufficiently wide bandwidth.  Signal 187 is a digital RFID signal after processing by a bar code digitizer.  Signal 187 is substantially the equivalent of dotted line 186, but processing signals in
the fashion that signal 186 is processed increases the interrogation range of the RFID system.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of one embodiment of a simultaneous bar code scanner/RFID circuit 200 according to the principles of the invention that is capable of simultaneously processing a bar code signal and an RFID signal.  The main
difference between this circuit and bar code scanner/RFID circuit 100 is found in the data acquisition path.
<BR><BR>Data acquisition circuit 205 preferably includes two separate data transfer paths.  Each path preferably includes peak detector 140, automatic gain control 142, gain and filter block 144, and digitizer 146.  This particular embodiment eliminates
the need for element 136 because the data signals from each of bar code scanner circuit 104 and RFID circuit 106 are transmitted directly to peak detector 140.
<BR><BR>One problem with this approach is that the digital signals produced by each of bar code scanner circuit 104 and RFID circuit 106 may arrive at central processing unit 108 substantially simultaneously.  This could create a situation where the
incoming signal must be sorted by central processing unit 108 before it can be deciphered.  In one embodiment, this problem can be overcome with additional configuration of the central processing unit to receive two signals simultaneously through a
single data acquisition circuit 105 (as is shown in FIG. 1).
<BR><BR>One preferable way to perform this step is by using first-in, first-out buffers (FIFO) 210 and 220.  These buffers take the first signal received from either bar code scanner circuit 104 or RFID circuit 106 and use it for identification, while
placing signals from the other circuit in a buffer.  The second signal received can then be used for verification.  Or, in another embodiment, the first signal can be used for providing an <B><I>encryption</I></B> key and then, with the key, the second signal can be
decrypted and used for identification.
<BR><BR>In an alternative embodiment, charge-coupled devices (CCD) or CMOS sensor-based devices can be substituted for the bar code data acquisition portion.  FIG. 3 shows one possible configuration of image capture circuitry to be substituted for the
laser-only bar code reading device.  Image illuminator 310 can be used to project the interrogation beam.  Image sensor 320 can be used to receive the reflected beam via focusing optics 330 and transmit an analog pixel signal 350 to data acquisition
circuit 105 because address sensor pixel signal 350 is similar to a bar code analog signal.  The operation of the image capture circuitry can be controlled by microcontroller 114 via control bus 340.
<BR><BR>Thus, it is seen that a bar code scanner/RFID circuit that fits an accepted form factor--e.g., a standard free-standing reader device, adds increased functionality, and that utilizes circuitry already present within the device to support the
added functionality has been provided.  In one embodiment of the invention, this circuit is capable of simultaneous bar code and RFID identification.  In other embodiments, it would be useful if in lieu of the bar code sensor front-ends, other analog or
digital output sensors were deployed.  Examples of such sensors include magstripe reader, temperature monitor, biometric reader and temperature sensor.  For example, a multi-functional engine could be used that can simultaneously read the RFID badge, as
well as a fingerprint signal for authentication.  Also, an RFID reader could take a sample of the environmental temperature at the time the product was received (e.g., for perishable goods).
<BR><BR>In a further embodiment, the first processing unit and second processing unit can be combined into a single processing unit.
<BR><BR>Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration rather than of limitation, and the present invention is limited only
by the claims which follow.
