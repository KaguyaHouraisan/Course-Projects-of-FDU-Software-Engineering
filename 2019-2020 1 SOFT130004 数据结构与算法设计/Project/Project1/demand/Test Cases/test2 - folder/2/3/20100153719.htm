<HR>
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0001]1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR>[0002]Aspects of the present invention relate to an authentication method,
     protocol and system for verifying authenticity of an entity such as a
     radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, a sensor node, or the like.
<BR><BR>[0003]2. Description of the Related Art
<BR><BR>[0004]Entity authentication involves sending an identity or characteristic
     information by one entity using wired or wireless communication network,
     and executing a protocol to authenticate the received information by a
     responding entity. The authentication mainly uses symmetric key or public
     key.
<BR><BR>[0005]Symmetric key-based <B><I>authentication is a protocol</I></B> by which entities
     participating in authentication exchange share a secret key on a
     one-to-one basis. This symmetric key authentication can guarantee high
     security, and entities involved in the authentication exchange can have
     symmetricity. However, the symmetric key authentication suffers from
     several shortcomings. That is, a large storage space is required to store
     secret keys, since symmetric key authentication requires that separate
     secret keys be generated and managed for each of the counterpart
     entities. Besides, a complicated hardware is required to manage the
     secret keys.
<BR><BR>[0006]Public key-based authentication can be used between a verifying
     entity (`verifier`) to authenticate a counterpart and a claimant entity
     (`claimant`) attempting to be authenticated, in which the entities
     involved in the authentication exchange share a public key provided by a
     public organization. The public key-based authentication may be executed
     asymmetrically. For example, if a device such as a RFID reader is the
     verifier and RFID tags are the claimants, the verifier and the claimants
     A and B can share a public key, while the claimant A and the verifier
     share a secret key A to execute authentication. The claimant B and the
     verifier can share a secret key B to perform authentication.
<BR><BR>[0007]While the verifier stores therein and manages all the keys required
     for authentication, including the secret keys A and B and the public key
     for the authentication with the claimants A and B, the claimant A stores
     the public key and secret key A, and the claimant B stores the public key
     and secret key B.
<BR><BR>[0008]The symmetric key authentication and public key authentication
     protocols need complicated authentication processes at the claimants to
     ensure high security. To perform complicated authentication processes,
     the hardware of the claimants has increased complexity and thus becomes
     more expensive. This makes the above authentication protocols unsuitable
     for use on a low-cost device such as RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0009]Particularly, considering that the hardware to generate pseudorandom
     number is expensive, there is a need for an <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B> for
     use with a RFID tag, which is capable of executing efficient
     authentication without requiring a pseudorandom number generator.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0010]Aspects of the present invention provide an entity in an
     authentication system applicable on a low-cost device without requiring a
     pseudorandom generating process.
<BR><BR>[0011]Aspects of the present invention also provide an authentication
     system and method which do not suffer from incompleteness problem.
<BR><BR>[0012]Aspects of the present invention also provide an authentication
     system and method which are secure against active attack.
<BR><BR>[0013]In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention,
     there is provided an authentication system including a verifying entity
     to authenticate a counterpart and a claimant entity attempting to be
     authenticated, in which the verifying entity and the claimant entity
     share a first and second shared secret keys and authentication is
     processed as the claimant entity responds to a challenge by the verifying
     entity. The verifying entity chooses a challenge key and a secret value,
     chooses a first calculated value based on the first shared secret key,
     the challenge key and the secret value, and sends the challenge key and
     the first calculated value to the claimant entity.
<BR><BR>[0014]The claimant entity receives the challenge key and the first
     calculated value from the verifying entity, and predicts a secret value
     that corresponds to the first calculated value based on the challenge
     key, the first calculated value and the first shared secret key.
<BR><BR>[0015]The claimant entity generates a first response value based on the
     second shared secret key and the challenge key and sends the first
     response value to the verifying entity, if the predicted secret value is
     a first value. If the predicted secret value is a second value, the
     claimant entity converts the challenge key using a permutation function
     shared with the verifying entity, generates a second response value based
     on the converted key and the second shared secret key, and sends the
     second response value to the verifying entity.
<BR><BR>[0016]In accordance with another example embodiment of the present
     invention, there is provided an authentication method according to which
     a verifying entity to authenticate a counterpart and a claimant entity
     attempting to be authenticated, share a plurality of secret keys and
     authentication is processed as the claimant entity responds to a
     challenge by the verifying entity. The authentication method may include
     the steps of: receiving a challenge key and a first calculated value from
     the verifying entity; predicting a secret value that corresponds to the
     first calculated value based on the first calculated value and a first
     shared secret key shared with the verifying entity; generating a first
     response value based on a second shared secret key shared with the
     verifying entity and the challenge key, if the predicted secret value is
     a first value; converting the challenge key using a permutation function
     shared with the verifying entity and generates a second response value
     based on the converted key and the second shared secret key, if the
     predicted secret value is a second value; and sending one of the first
     and second response values to the verifying entity.
<BR><BR>[0017]In accordance with yet another example embodiment of the present
     invention, there is provided an authentication method a verifying entity
     to authenticate a counterpart and a claimant entity attempting to be
     authenticated, share a plurality of secret keys and the verifying entity
     verifies authenticity of the claimant entity. The authentication method
     may include the steps of: choosing a challenge key and a secret value;
     generating a first calculated value based on a first shared secret key
     shared with the claimant entity, the chosen challenge key, and the secret
     value; sending the challenge key and the first calculated value to the
     claimant entity; receiving a response value to the challenge key and the
     first calculated value from the claimant entity; and verifying the
     response value based on a second shared secret key shared with the
     claimant entity, the challenge key and the secret value.
<BR><BR>[0018]Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
<BR><BR>[0024]Reference will now be made in detail to the example embodiments of
     the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the
     accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like
     elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to
     explain the aspects of the present invention by referring to the figures.
<BR><BR>[0025]HB <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B> proposed by Hopper and Blum brought new
     approach to designing lightweight cryptographic protocols. HB
     <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B> is based on a new foundation called Learning
     Parity with Noise (LPN) problem. The core operation in the LPN problem is
     binary inner-product which requires just a linear number of XOR and AND
     operations.
<BR><BR>[0026]LPN problem has been extensively studied and known to be
     nondeterministic polynomial-complete (NP-complete).
<BR><BR>[0027]It is known to take 2.sup.O(n/log n) even for the fastest algorithm
     to solve the LPN problem.
<BR><BR>[0028]Unfortunately, HB protocol is designed for human-to-computer
     authentication, and cannot be used for device-to-device authentication.
     An improved protocol called HB+ proposed by Juels and Weis made it
     possible to use this kind of protocol for device-to-device
     authentication.
<BR><BR>[0029]However, both HB and HB+ suffer from a problem called
     incompleteness. That is, even though genuine claimant and verifier follow
     protocols correctly, there is still a chance that authentication may
     fail.
<BR><BR>[0030]In addition, both HB and HB+ require pseudorandom number generator
     from a claimant side, that is, from a RFID tag. The RFID tag needs a
     complicated hardware to generate a pseudorandom number, which increases
     the price of the RFID tag. Accordingly, an improved protocol is required,
     by which a low-cost device such as a RFID tag can maintain security
     without requiring a pseudorandom number generator.
<BR><BR>[0031]The authentication system and method according to an exemplary
     embodiment of the present invention use a cryptography based on HB
     protocol, is perfectly complete and requires no pseudorandom number
     generator on a RFID tag.
<BR><BR>[0032]FIG. 1 illustrates q rounds of authentication steps executed between
     a RFID reader as a verifier and a RFID tag as a claimant.
<BR><BR>[0033]Efforts have constantly been made to make it easier to identify
     persons or products especially in the field of commerce. The identity
     cards or passwords can be the typical examples of the ways to verify the
     identity of a person, and these traditional methods have appropriately
     been adapted for use on electronic devices.
<BR><BR>[0034]However, passwords are easily exposed or stolen. For example, a
     malicious attacker may steal a credit card password and withdraw deposit
     from a credit card owner's account.
<BR><BR>[0035]The magnetic card or radio frequency identification (RFID) is the
     technology introduced to prevent one's identity or password from being
     exposed to such a potential identity thief. The RFID enables recognition
     of information in from several centimeters to several meters of distance
     depending on the design.
<BR><BR>[0036]The speed of recognition is approximately 0.01.about.0.1 seconds,
     which is faster and less subjective to an external influence than the
     other types of media such as magnetic.
<BR><BR>[0037]The RFID technology chip also can store relatively a large amount of
     information.
<BR><BR>[0038]The RFID technology is achieved by data transmission and reception
     between a RFID reader and a RFID tag. The RFID tag may include an
     integrated circuit (IC) to store information, and an antenna. The
     capacity of the RFID tag to store information depends on the size of
     memory embedded in the IC chip.
<BR><BR>[0039]The RFID reader may provide energy to operate the RFID tag. The RFID
     reader may send a command, requesting the RFID tag to perform a specific
     operation. Accordingly, in response to the command from the RFID reader,
     the RFID tag may send data to the RFID reader.
<BR><BR>[0040]The RFID reader and RFID tag may communicate in an inductively
     coupled manner, or by using electromagnetic waves. The inductively
     coupled scheme is generally used for short distance communication which
     is generally within 1 meter, while the electromagnetic wave-based scheme
     is generally used for middle, or long distance communication exceeding 1
     meter.
<BR><BR>[0041]The energy to operate the RFID tag may be provided by the RFID
     reader. Alternatively, the RFID tag may be connected to an energy source
     such as a battery.
<BR><BR>[0042]According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a
     verifier, including RFID reader, may request a claimant, including RFID
     tag, a response. If the claimant sends a response message to the verifier
     in response, the verifier determines whether or not the response message
     meets a predetermined rule. If the received response message meets the
     predetermined rule, the verifier determines the claimant to be a genuine
     entity and thus gives an access to the information stored in the
     verifier.
<BR><BR>[0043]However, if the response message from the claimant does not meet the
     predetermined rule, the verifier determines authentication to have
     failed, and refuses the access of the claimant to the verifier.
<BR><BR>[0044]According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, if
     the authentication is successful, the verifier may additionally read data
     stored in the claimant, and update the data previously stored in the
     verifier based on the read data. In this case, the verifier may send a
     data request command to the claimant, and the claimant may send the
     requested data to the verifier in response.
<BR><BR>[0045]According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the
     verifier may include, or be connected to a database to store information
     about the registered claimants.
<BR><BR>[0046]According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the
     verifier may control a mobile device. Accordingly, if authentication is
     successful, the verifier may allow the claimant to use the mobile device.
<BR><BR>[0047]The operation of the verifier requesting a response from the
     claimant, and determining authentication to be a success or failure based
     on the received response message, may form one authentication step.
<BR><BR>[0048]The authentication steps may be executed independently, and
     authentication is considered to be successful if all q rounds of
     authentication steps are successful. The q steps may be executed in
     parallel or sequentially.
<BR><BR>[0049]The verifier and the claimant may generate session bits in each of
     the authentication steps, and thus generate q-bit session keys throughout
     the q steps.
<BR><BR>[0050]FIG. 2 illustrates in detail each of authentication steps of FIG. 1
     according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0051]The tag 101 and the reader 102 share two secret keys, namely, x and
     y. The tag 101 and the reader 102 also share a permutation function f( ).
     The permutation function f( ) may be a system parameter.
<BR><BR>[0052]The reader 102 may store therein a probability distribution D. The
     tag 101 does not need to store a probability distribution.
<BR><BR>[0053]The reader 102 generates a k-bit challenge key a. Each bit of the
     challenge key a may have one of the values {0, 1}. The reader 102 may
     generate a challenge key a randomly. Herein, k may be an integer equal
     to, or greater than 2. For example, k may be 16, 32, 48, 64, or 128.
<BR><BR>[0054]The reader 102 may choose a 1-bit first secret value v. The reader
     102 may choose the first secret value v according to a probability
     distribution D. The probability distribution D may be treated as a
     secret. The probability distribution D may be a uniform function or
     other.
<BR><BR>[0055]The reader 102 may compute a binary inner-product B (a, x) of the
     challenge key a and the first shared secret key x. The reader 102
     generates a first calculated value w, which may be expressed by:
<BR><BR>w=B(a,x)v  [Mathematical formula 1]
<BR><BR>[0056]where, denotes  a logical XOR operation.
<BR><BR>[0057]The binary inner-product of bit streams of k bit may be computed as
     explained below.
<BR><BR>[0058]Given two k-bit numbers a=(a.sub.0a.sub.1 . . . a.sub.k-1).sub.2 and
     x=(x.sub.0x.sub.1 . . . x.sub.k-1).sub.2, the binary inner product of a
     and x, denoted as B(a, x), can be computed as follows:
<BR><BR>B(a,x)=(a.sub.0x.sub.0)(a.sub.1x.sub.1) . . . (a.sub.k-1x.sub.k-1)
     [Mathematical formula 2]
<BR><BR>[0059]where  denotes a logical AND operation.
<BR><BR>[0060]The reader 102 sends the challenge key a and the first calculated
     value w to the tag 101.
<BR><BR>[0061]If the probability distribution D is uniform, the LPN problem
     instance formed by a collection of (a, w) is intractable. If D is unknown
     or uniform, the attack on the LPN problem is not effective, and thus the
     <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B> according to an exemplary embodiment of the
     present invention is secure against the active attack.
<BR><BR>[0062]The tag 101 is capable of predicting the first secret value v using
     the received challenge key a and the first calculated value w. The tag
     101 may use the first shared secret key x, which is given beforehand, for
     the prediction of the first secret value v. The predicted first secret
     value v can be expressed by:
<BR><BR>v=B(a,x)w  [Mathematical formula 3]
<BR><BR>[0063]The tag 101 may choose one of the first and second encryption
     equations, depending on whether the predicted first secret key v is the
     first value or the second value. The tag 101 may generate a response
     value z based on the selected equation. For example, it is assumed that
     the first encryption equation is selected if v=0. The first encryption
     equation may be expressed by:
<BR><BR>z=B(a,y)  [Mathematical formula 4]
<BR><BR>[0064]where y is the second shared secret key given to the tag 101 and the
     reader 102 beforehand.
<BR><BR>[0065]It is assumed that the second encryption equation is selected if
     v.noteq.0. The second encryption equation may be expressed by:
<BR><BR>z=B(f(a),y')  [Mathematical formula 5]
<BR><BR>[0066]where y' is a bit-wise inverse of the second shared secret key y.
<BR><BR>[0067]f(a) is a bit stream obtained by permuting position of each bit of
     the challenge key a. For example, if a=(a.sub.0a.sub.1a.sub.2 . . .
     a.sub.(k-1)).sub.2, it is possible that f(a)=(a.sub.1a.sub.2a.sub.3 . . .
     a.sub.(k-1)a.sub.0).sub.2. Alternatively, it is possible that
     f(a)=(a.sub.1a.sub.0a.sub.3a.sub.2 . . . a.sub.(k-1)a.sub.(k-2)).sub.2.
     f(a) generally has different results of k!, if the challenge key a has
     k-bit. The attacker on the authentication system needs to have
     information about the permutation function f( ) used by the tag 101 and
     the reader 102, in addition to the challenge key a, the first calculated
     value w, and the response value z between the reader 102 and the tag 101.
     Since the tag 101 is capable of providing variations corresponding to k!
     without generating a pseudorandom number by permuting the challenge key
     a, the tag 101 has hardware of reduced complexity and yet provides
     increased authentication efficiency according to the exemplary
     embodiments of the present invention. For example, if k=32, variations of
     32!=2.63.times.10.sup.35 are possible, and thus the possibility of having
     hacking decreases significantly.
<BR><BR>[0068]The tag 101 may generate a response value z based on the predicted
     first secret key v, using the first encryption equation or the second
     encryption equation. The tag 101 sends the response value z to the reader
     102.
<BR><BR>[0069]The reader 102 chooses one of the first and second encryption
     equations based on the first secret key v, and verifies the response
     value z using the selected equation.
<BR><BR>[0070]If v=0, the reader 102 verifies that z=B(a, y); Otherwise, the
     reader 102 checks if z=B(f(a), y').
<BR><BR>[0071]The reader 102 determines that the authentication is successful if
     v=0, and z=B(a, y). Additionally, the reader 102 may determine that the
     authentication is successful if v.noteq.0 and z=B(f(a), y'). Otherwise,
     the reader 102 determines that the authentication is unsuccessful.
<BR><BR>[0072]Since the tag 101 can compute the response value z using one of the
     two different formulas, it is unnecessary to add a separate noise
     component or random number. This authentication sequence thus removes
     incompleteness problem.
<BR><BR>[0073]The <B><I>authentication protocol</I></B> according to the exemplary embodiments
     of the present invention may be shortly named as HB-c. HB-c is secure
     against active attack. HB-c protocol may improve the security level by
     using a permutation function.
<BR><BR>[0074]According to HB-c protocol, the satisfactory level of security is
     possible even when the tag 101 does not have a pseudorandom number
     generator. Therefore, HB-c protocol is suitably applicable on the
     low-cost devices such as RFID tags or sensor nodes.
<BR><BR>[0075]HB-c protocol also does not suffer from incompleteness problem.
<BR><BR>[0076]HB-c also allows flexibility in choosing a security parameter (the
     noise distribution D). This potentially improves security strength of
     HB-c even more
<BR><BR>[0077]FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating in detail the authentication
     process executed at the tag 101 of FIG. 2 according to an exemplary
     embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0078]The tag 101 receives a challenge key a and the first calculated
     value w from a verifier, that is, the reader 102 at S310.
<BR><BR>[0079]The tag 101 predicts a secret value v, using the challenge key a,
     first calculated value w and first shared secret key x at S320. The
     operation at S320 may be performed using mathematical formula 3 explained
     above.
<BR><BR>[0080]The tag 101 checks if the predicted secret value is 0, and if so,
     generates a response value z using the challenge key a and the second
     shared secret key y at S340. The operation at S340 may be performed using
     mathematical formula 4 explained above. The tag 101 generates response
     value z by computing a binary inner-product of the challenge key a and
     the second shared secret key y. Since the binary inner-product operation
     consists of logical AND and logical XOR operations, this can be
     implemented on a simple hardware.
<BR><BR>[0081]If the predicted secret value is not 0, the tag 101 generates a
     response value z using the challenge key a, the permutation function f(
     ), and the second shared secret key y at S350. The operation at S350 may
     be performed using mathematical formula 5 explained above. The tag 101
     may compute a bit-wise inverse (y') of the second shared secret key y,
     and also a binary inner-product of f(a) and y' to generate a response
     value z. Since the bit-wise inverse computation is also implementable on
     a simple hardware, the tag 101 does not require a complicated hardware
     and thus is suitable for the low-cost devices such as RFID tags.
<BR><BR>[0082]The tag 101 sends a response value z, either generated at S340 or
     S350, to the verifier, that is, to the reader 102 at S360.
<BR><BR>[0083]The tag 101 may execute q rounds of S310 to S360 independently.
     Since the reader 102 considers the authentication to be successful only
     when all q rounds are successful, the higher q ensures the higher
     security.
<BR><BR>[0084]FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating in detail the process of
     authentication executed at the reader 102 of FIG. 2 according to an
     exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0085]The reader 102 chooses a challenge key a and a secret value v at
     S410.
<BR><BR>[0086]The reader 102 may generate a secret value v based on a probability
     distribution D. The probability distribution D may be uniform function or
     other. If the probability distribution D is uniform, the LPN problem
     instance formed by a collection of (a, w) is intractable, and so the
     attack on the LPN problem is ineffective.
<BR><BR>[0087]The reader 102 has flexibility in choosing a probability
     distribution D, and this potentially improves security strength of the
     present invention even more.
<BR><BR>[0088]The reader 102 generates a first calculated value w using the
     challenge key a, the secret value v, and the first shared secret key x at
     S420. The operation at S420 may be performed using mathematical formula 1
     explained above.
<BR><BR>[0089]The reader 102 sends the challenge key a, and the first calculated
     value w to the tag 101 at S430.
<BR><BR>[0090]The reader 102 receives a response value z from the tag 101 at S440.
     The response value z is the value generated as the tag 101 executes S310
     to S360.
<BR><BR>[0091]The reader 102 checks the secret value v, and based on the secret
     value v, chooses an encryption equation to be used in verifying the
     response value z. The reader 102 verifies if the secret value v is 0 at
     S450.
<BR><BR>[0092]If the secret value v is 0, the reader 102 verifies if the response
     value z meets mathematical formula 4 at S460. If the response value z
     meets mathematical formula 4, the reader 102 verifies that the
     authentication is successful at S480. If the response value z does not
     meet mathematical formula 4, the reader 102 determines the authentication
     to have failed at S490.
<BR><BR>[0093]If the secret value v is not 0, the reader 102 determines if the
     response value z meets mathematical formula 5 at S470. If the response
     value z meets mathematical formula 5, the reader 102 verifies that the
     authentication is successful at S481. If the response value z does not
     meet mathematical formula 5, the reader 102 determines the authentication
     to have failed at S490.
<BR><BR>[0094]The reader 102 may execute q rounds of S410 to S490. These q rounds
     may be independent from, or dependent on one another. The q rounds can be
     executed sequentially or in parallel.
<BR><BR>[0095]The reader 102 considers the authentication to be successful only
     when the authentication of all q rounds is considered to be successful.
     Each of q rounds may independently use the secret value v which is
     generated by a probability distribution D. If the probability
     distribution D is uniform, the secret value v generated in the q rounds
     has randomness, and thus is hardly tractable by an attacker. Therefore,
     higher q ensures higher security of a system according to an exemplary
     embodiment of the present invention.
<BR><BR>[0096]The method according to the exemplary embodiments of the present
     invention may be realized as a program command which can be executed by a
     variety of computer means, and recorded on a computer-readable medium.
     The `computer-readable medium` herein may refer to a program command,
     data file, data structure, or any combination thereof. The program
     command recorded on the medium may be designed and constructed
     specifically for application of the exemplary embodiments of the present
     invention, or alternatively, the program command may be that which is
     already known to and used by those skilled in the field of computer
     software. The computer readable medium may include a magnetic media such
     as hard disk, floppy disk or magnetic tape, an optical media such as
     CD-ROM or DVD, a magneto-optical media such as floptical disk, and a
     hardware device such as ROM, RAM or flash memory, which is constructed
     specifically to store and execute the program command. The program
     command may include not only a mechanical language code which is
     constructed by a compiler, but also an advanced language code which can
     be executed on a computer using appropriate tool such as an interpreter.
     The hardware device may be designed to operate as one or more software
     modules to execute the steps according to the exemplary embodiments of
     the present invention, or the opposite is also possible.
<BR><BR>[0097]While there have been illustrated and described what are considered
     to be example embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood
     by those skilled in the art and as technology develops that various
     changes and modifications, may be made, and equivalents may be
     substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true scope of
     the present invention. Many modifications, permutations, additions and
     sub-combinations may be made to adapt the teachings of the present
     invention to a particular situation without departing from the scope
     thereof.
<BR><BR>[0098]Accordingly, it is intended, therefore, that the present invention
     not be limited to the various example embodiments disclosed, but that the
     present invention includes all embodiments falling within the scope of
     the appended claims.
