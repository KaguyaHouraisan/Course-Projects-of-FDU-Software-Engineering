<BR><BR>FIELD OF INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0002]This invention generally relates to facilitating a radio frequency
     device transaction, and more particularly, to facilitating a financial
     transaction using a first funding source and a second funding source.
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0003]Like barcode and voice data entry, RFID is a contactless information
     acquisition technology. RFID systems are wireless, and are usually
     extremely effective in hostile environments where conventional
     acquisition methods fail. RFID has established itself in a wide range of
     markets, such as, for example, the high-speed reading of railway
     containers, tracking moving objects such as livestock or automobiles, and
     retail inventory applications. As such, RFID technology has become a
     primary focus in automated data collection, identification and analysis
     systems worldwide.
<BR><BR>[0004]Of late, companies are increasingly embodying RFID data acquisition
     technology in a fob or tag for use in completing financial transactions.
     A typical fob includes a transponder and is ordinarily a self-contained
     device which may be contained on any portable form factor. In some
     instances, a battery may be included with the fob to power the
     transponder. In which case the internal circuitry of the fob (including
     the transponder) may draw its operating power from the battery power
     source. Alternatively, the fob may exist independently of an internal
     power source. In this instance the internal circuitry of the fob
     (including the transponder) may gain its operating power directly from an
     RF interrogation signal. U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,774 issued to Schuermann
     describes a typical transponder RF interrogation system which may be
     found in the prior art. The Schuermann patent describes in general the
     powering technology surrounding conventional transponder structures. U.S.
     Pat. No. 4,739,328 discusses a method by which a conventional transponder
     may respond to a RF interrogation signal. Other typical modulation
     techniques which may be used include, for example, ISO/IEC 14443 and the
     like.
<BR><BR>[0005]In the conventional fob powering technologies used, the fob is
     typically activated upon presenting the fob in an interrogation signal.
     In this regard, the fob may be activated irrespective of whether the user
     desires such activation. Inadvertent presentation of the fob may result
     in initiation and completion of an unwanted transaction. Thus, a fob
     system is needed which allows the fob user to control activation of the
     fob to limit transactions being undesirably completed.
<BR><BR>[0006]One of the more visible uses of the RFID technology is found in the
     introduction of Exxon/Mobil's Speedpass.RTM. and Shell's EasyPay.RTM.
     products. These products use transponders placed in a fob or tag which
     enables automatic identification of the user when the fob is presented at
     a Point of Sale (POS) device. Fob identification data is typically passed
     to a third party server database, where the identification data is
     referenced to a customer (e.g., user) credit or debit account. In an
     exemplary processing method, the server seeks authorization for the
     transaction by passing the transaction and account data to an authorizing
     entity. Once authorization is received by the server, clearance is sent
     to the point of sale device for completion of the transaction. In this
     way, the conventional transaction processing method involves an indirect
     path which causes undue overhead due to the use of the third-party
     server.
<BR><BR>[0007]A need exists for a transaction authorization system which allows
     fob transactions to be authorized while eliminating the cost associated
     with using third-party servers.
<BR><BR>[0008]In addition, conventional fobs are limited in that they must be used
     in proximity to the Point of Sale device. That is, for fob activation,
     conventional fobs must be positioned within the area of transmission cast
     by the RF interrogation signal. More particularly, conventional fobs are
     not affective for use in situations where the user wishes to conduct a
     transaction at a point of interaction such as a computer interface.
<BR><BR>[0009]Therefore, a need exists for a fob embodying RFID acquisition
     technology, which is capable of use at a point of interaction device and
     which is additionally capable of facilitating transactions via a computer
     interface connected to a network (e.g., the Internet).
<BR><BR>[0010]Existing transponder-reader payment systems are also limited in that
     the conventional fob used in the systems is only responsive to one
     interrogation signal. Where multiple interrogation signals are used, the
     fob is only responsive to the interrogation signal to which it is
     configured. Thus, if the RFID reader of the system provides only an
     interrogation signal to which the fob is incompatible, the fob will not
     be properly activated.
<BR><BR>[0011]Therefore, a need exists for a fob which is responsive to more than
     one interrogation signal.
<BR><BR>[0012]Existing transponder-reader payment systems are additionally limited
     in that the payment systems are typically linked to a funding source
     associated with the transponder which includes a predetermined spending
     limit. Thus no flexibility is provided in instances where the payment is
     requested which exceeds the predetermined spending limit. This is
     typically true since traditional methods for processing a requested
     transaction involve comparing the transaction to the spending limit or to
     an amount stored in a preloaded value data file prior to providing
     transaction authorization to a merchant.
<BR><BR>[0013]Thus, a system is needed which processes transponder-reader payment
     requests irrespective of the spending limit assigned to an associated
     transponder-reader payment system funding source.
<BR><BR>[0014]Further, traditional transponder-reader systems do not permit the
     user to manage the system user account data. This is extremely
     problematic where the user wishes to change a transponder-reader system
     funding source to a source which provides more available spending room,
     or where changes are made to user's status (e.g., change in address,
     phone number, email, etc.) for which the transponder-reader account
     provider wishes to readily update the user's account.
<BR><BR>[0015]Thus a need exists for a transponder-reader system which will allow
     the user limited access to the transponder-reader account for managing
     account data.
<BR><BR>[0016]Further still, existing transponder-reader systems do not permit
     means for automatically incenting the use of the fob associated with the
     system as opposed to the credit or charge card associated with the fob.
     That is, conventional transponder-reader systems do not provide a means
     for encouraging usage of the transponder reader system by encouraging use
     of the fob product since the present systems do not distinguish between
     usage of a system transponder and a charge or credit card account
     associated with the transponder.
<BR><BR>[0017]Consequently, a need exists for a transponder-reader system which is
     capable of determining when a system transponder is used, and incenting
     such usage.
<BR><BR>[0018]Still further, present systems are limited in that the systems are
     unable to track credit or charge card usage and fob usage for a single
     funding source. For example, in typical prior art systems, a fob may be
     linked to a specified funding source (e.g., American Express, MasterCard,
     Visa, etc.) which may be used to provide funds for satisfaction of a
     transaction request. The funding source may additionally have a consumer
     credit or charge card which may be associated with the fob and which may
     be used for contact transactions. Where the credit or charge card is
     used, a statement reporting the card usage is provided to the card user.
     However, the reporting statement does not include a reporting of the fob
     product usage. Thus, a fob user is unable to chart, analyze or compare
     fob usage to the usage of the associated card. This is especially
     problematic where the funding source is used by more than one entity
     (e.g., spouses, multiple company personnel, etc.) where one entity may
     use the fob and a separate entity may use the card associated with the
     fob.
<BR><BR>[0019]Thus, a need exists for a transponder-reader payment system which
     would permit reporting of the fob usage and the credit card usage in a
     single file.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>[0020]Described herein is a system and method for using RFID technology to
     initiate and complete financial transactions. The transponder-reader
     payment system described herein may include an RFID reader operable to
     provide a RF interrogation signal for powering a transponder system,
     receiving a transponder system RF signal, and providing transponder
     system account data relative to the transponder system RF signal. The
     transponder-reader payment system may include an RFID protocol/sequence
     controller in electrical communication with one or more interrogators for
     providing an interrogation signal to a transponder, an RFID
     authentication circuit for authenticating the signal received from the
     transponder, a serial or parallel interface for interfacing with a point
     of interaction device, and an USB or serial interface for use in
     personalizing the RFID reader and/or the transponder. The
     transponder-reader payment system may further include a fob including one
     or more transponders (e.g., modules) responsive to one or more
     interrogation signals and for providing an authentication signal for
     verifying that the transponder and/or the RFID reader are authorized to
     operate within the transponder reader payment system. In this way, the
     fob may be responsive to multiple interrogation signals provided at
     different frequencies. Further, the fob may include a USB or serial
     interface for use with a computer network or with the RFID reader.
<BR><BR>[0021]In one embodiment, the RFID reader receives, from the RFID
     transponder device, a code that is associated with a first funding source
     and a second funding source. The RFID reader communicates a request
     associated with a transaction to a payment processor. The request
     includes the code and the transaction is funded using the first funding
     source and the second funding source associated with the code. In one
     embodiment, the transaction is funded according to a funding account
     protocol associated with the code.
<BR><BR>[0022]The RFID system and method according to the present invention may
     include an RFID transponder device which may be embodied in a fob, tag,
     card or any other form factor (e.g., wristwatch, keychain, cell phone,
     etc.), which may be capable of being presented for interrogation. In that
     regard, although the transponder is described herein as embodied in a
     fob, the invention is not so limited. The system may further include an
     RFID reader configured to send a standing RFID recognition signal which
     may be transmitted from the RFID reader via radio frequency (or
     electromagnetic) propagation. The fob may be placed within proximity to
     the RFID reader such that the RFID signal may interrogate the fob and
     initialize fob identification procedures.
<BR><BR>[0023]In one exemplary embodiment, as a part of the identification
     process, the fob and the RFID reader may engage in mutual authentication.
     The RFID reader may identify the fob as including an authorized system
     transponder for receiving encrypted information and storing the
     information on the fob memory. Similarly, the fob, upon interrogation by
     the RFID reader, may identify the RFID reader as authorized to 25 receive
     the encrypted and stored information. Where the RFID reader and the fob
     successfully mutually authenticate, the fob may transmit to the RFID
     reader certain information identifying the transaction account or
     accounts to which the fob is associated. The RFID reader may receive the
     information and forward the information to facilitate the completion of a
     transaction. In one exemplary embodiment, the RFID reader may forward the
     information to a point of interaction device (e.g., POS or computer
     interface) for transaction completion. The mutual authorization process
     disclosed herein aids in ensuring fob transponder-reader payment system
     security.
<BR><BR>[0024]In another exemplary embodiment, the fob according to the present
     invention, includes means for completing transactions via a computer
     interface. The fob may be connected to the computer using a USB or serial
     interface fob account information may be transferred to the computer for
     use in completing a transaction via a network (e.g., the Internet). In
     yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a system is
     provided which incents usage of the transponder-reader system transponder
     (e.g., fob). The system distinguishes between the usage of a fob and the
     usage of a charge or credit card sharing the same funding source as the
     fob. Where the fob is used, the system may provide reward points to the
     user based on criteria predetermined by the issuer. Additionally, where a
     preloaded fob system is used, the present invention recognizes when the
     associated fob preloaded value data file is loaded or reloaded with
     funds. The invention then may provide reward points based on the criteria
     associated with the loading or reloading action. Further, the system
     according to this invention may incent patronage of a merchant. In this
     case, the system may receive a fob transaction request and incent the fob
     user based on a marker or other identifier correlated with the merchant.
     The marker may be included in the transaction identification, in a
     merchant identification provided with the transaction, or a combination
     of both.
<BR><BR>[0025]In still another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a system is
     disclosed which enables the user to manage the account associated with
     the fob. The user is provided limited access to all or a portion of the
     fob account information stored on the account provider database for
     updating, for example, demographic information, account funding source,
     funding account protocol and/or account restrictions (e.g., spending
     limits, personal identification number, etc.). Access to all or a portion
     of the account may be provided to the user telephonically or via a
     network (e.g., online).
<BR><BR>[0026]In yet another exemplary embodiment of the invention, a system is
     provided whereby the user is permitted to select one or more funding
     sources for use in satisfying a merchant request. The user may switch
     funding sources manually by, for example, contacting the fob account
     provider and indicating that a particular funding source is desired. The
     user may contact the provider or any other third party that can
     facilitate changing the funding source via any means known in the art
     such as, for example, telephone, voice response, internet, cell phone,
     modem, email, webpage submission and/or any other electronic, optical or
     digital methods for communication. In this way, the user is permitted to
     change funding sources from a primary funding source to a secondary
     funding source. In this context, a "primary" funding source may be the
     funding source which the account provider may primarily use to retrieve
     funds and satisfy all or a portion of a merchant transaction request. A
     "secondary" funding source may be any alternate funding source from which
     value may be retrieved for satisfying all or a portion of a transaction
     request. It should be noted that primary and secondary are used herein to
     illustrate that more than one funding source may be chosen by the user
     for association with the fob, and that any number of sources may be
     selected.
<BR><BR>[0027]In addition, the fob user may provide the fob account provider with
     a funding protocol for use in determining which funding source to use.
     For example, the fob user may designate that for a particular merchant,
     type of merchant or type of transaction, a selected funding source is to
     be automatically used. In this way, the fob user is assured that
     particular transactions will be satisfied (e.g., completed) using an
     identified funding source and/or the fob account provider may send all
     similar transactions to an identified funding source, thereby
     facilitating tracking of the similar transactions.
<BR><BR>[0028]The funding protocol may additionally include guidelines for
     automatically changing to a secondary funding source when the requested
     transaction amount meets or exceeds the available value of the primary
     funding source. That is, the funding protocol indicates to the account
     provider that the funds for satisfying the merchant request should be
     retrieved from a secondary funding source when the value in the primary
     funding source is insufficient for completing the transaction.
     Alternatively, the funding protocol may indicate to the account provider
     that the transaction should be completed using value from both the
     primary and secondary funding sources. The amount retrieved from the
     primary and secondary funding sources may be based on a calculated
     formula defined by the fob user or fob issuer. In a typical example,
     where a particular transaction or merchant is identified by the account
     provider (e.g., by use of the markers described above), the account
     provider may seek to retrieve a percentage of the value needed from the
     primary funding source with the balance of the transaction retrieved from
     the secondary funding source. Alternatively, the value in the primary
     funding source may be depleted prior to retrieving the balance of the
     requested transaction from the secondary funding source.
<BR><BR>[0029]In a further exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides
     methods for processing a transaction request whereby the amount of the
     transaction request may be approved prior to requesting funding from the
     funding source and/or verifying that the amount for completing the
     transaction is available. In this way, the transaction may be approved
     provided the transaction and/or account meets certain predetermined
     authorization criteria. Once the criteria is met, the transaction is
     authorized and authorization is provided to the requesting agent (e.g.,
     merchant). In one instance the payment for the transaction is requested
     from the funding source simultaneously to, or immediately following, the
     providing of the authorization to the merchant.
<BR><BR>[0030]In another instance the payment for transactions is requested at a
     time period later than when the authorization is provided to the
     merchant. These features and other advantages of the system and method,
     as well as the structure and operation of various exemplary embodiments
     of the system and method, are described below.

<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION
<BR><BR>[0047]The present invention may be described herein in terms of functional
     block components, screen shots, optional selections and various
     processing steps. Such functional blocks may be realized by any number of
     hardware and/or software components configured to perform to specified
     functions. For example, the present invention may employ various
     integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, processing
     elements, logic elements, look-up tables, and the like, which may carry
     out a variety of functions under the control of one or more
     microprocessors or other control devices. Similarly, the software
     elements of the present invention may be implemented with any programming
     or scripting language such as C, C++, Java, COBOL, assembler, PERL,
     extensible markup language (XML), JavaCard and MULTOS with the various
     algorithms being implemented with any combination of data structures,
     objects, processes, routines or other programming elements. Further, it
     should be noted that the present invention may employ any number of
     conventional techniques for data transmission, signaling, data
     processing, network control, and the like. For a basic introduction on
     cryptography, review a text written by Bruce Schneier entitled "Applied
     Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C," published by
     John Wiley & Sons (second edition, 1996), herein incorporated by
     reference.
<BR><BR>[0048]In addition, many applications of the present invention could be
     formulated. The exemplary network disclosed herein may include any system
     for exchanging data or transacting business, such as the internet, an
     intranet, an extranet, WAN, LAN, satellite communications, and/or the
     like. It is noted that the network may be implemented as other types of
     networks, such as an interactive television network (ITN).
<BR><BR>[0049]Where required, the system user may interact with the system via any
     input device such as, a keypad, keyboard, mouse, kiosk, personal digital
     assistant, handheld computer (e.g., Palm Pilot.RTM., Blackberry.RTM.,
     cellular phone and/or the like. Similarly, the invention could be used in
     conjunction with any type of personal computer, network computer, work
     station, minicomputer, mainframe, or the like running any operating
     system such as any version of Windows, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows
     98, Windows 95, MacOS, OS/2, BeOS, Linux, UNIX, Solaris or the like.
     Moreover, although the invention may frequently be described as being
     implemented with TCP/IP communications protocol, it should be understood
     that the invention could also be implemented using SNA, IPX, Appletalk,
     IPte, NetBIOS, OSI or any number of communications protocols. Moreover,
     the system contemplates, the use, sale, or distribution of any goods,
     services or information over any network having similar functionality
     described herein.
<BR><BR>[0050]FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary RFID transaction system 100A in
     accordance with the present invention, wherein exemplary components for
     use in completing a fob transaction are depicted. In general, the
     operation of system 100A may begin when fob 102 is presented for payment,
     and is interrogated by RFID reader 104 or, alternatively, interface 134.
     Fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may then engage in mutual authentication
     after which the transponder 102 may provide the transponder
     identification and/or account identifier to the RFID reader 104 which may
     further provide the information to the merchant system 130 POS device
     110.
<BR><BR>[0051]System 100A may include a fob 102 having a transponder 114 and an
     RFID reader 104 in RF communication with fob 102. Although the present
     invention is described with respect to a fob 102, the invention is not to
     be so limited. Indeed, system 100 may include any device having a
     transponder which is configured to communicate with an RFID reader 104
     via RF communication. Typical devices may include, for example, a key
     ring, tag, card, cell phone, wristwatch or any such form capable of being
     presented for interrogation.
<BR><BR>[0052]The RFID reader 104 may be configured to communicate using an RFID
     internal antenna 106. Alternatively, RFID reader 104 may include an
     external antenna 108 for communications with fob 102, where the external
     antenna may be made remote to the RFID reader 104 using a suitable cable
     and/or data link 120. RFID reader 104 may be further in communication
     with a merchant system 130 via a data link 122. The system 100A may
     include a transaction completion system including a point of interaction
     device such as, for example, a merchant point of sale (POS) device 110 or
     a computer interface (e.g., user interface) 134. In one exemplary
     embodiment the transaction completion system may include a merchant
     system 130 including the POS device 110 in communication with an RFID
     reader 104 (via data link 122). As described more fully below, the
     transaction completion system may include the user interface 134
     connected to a network 136 and to the transponder via a USB connector
     132.
<BR><BR>[0053]Although the point of interaction device is described herein with
     respect to a merchant point of sale (POS) device, the invention is not to
     be so limited. Indeed, a merchant POS device is used herein by way of
     example, and the point of interaction device may be any device capable of
     receiving fob account data. In this regard, the POS may be any point of
     interaction device enabling the user to complete a transaction using a
     fob 102. POS device 110 may be in further communication with a customer
     interface 118 (via data link 128) for entering at least a customer
     identity verification information. In addition, POS device 110 may be in
     communication with a merchant host network 112 (via data link 124) for
     processing any transaction request. In this arrangement, information
     provided by RFID reader 104 is provided to the POS device 110 of merchant
     system 130 via data link 122. The POS device 110 may receive the
     information (and alternatively may receive any identity verifying
     information from customer interface 118 via data link 128) and provide
     the information to host system 112 for processing.
<BR><BR>[0054]A variety of conventional communications media and protocols may be
     used for data links 120, 122, 124, and 128. For example, data links 120,
     122, 124, and 128 may be an Internet Service Provider (ISP) configured to
     facilitate communications over a local loop as is typically used in
     connection with standard modem communication, cable modem, dish networks,
     ISDN, Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL), or any wireless communication
     media. In addition, the merchant system 130 including the POS device 110
     and host network 112 may reside on a local area network which interfaces
     to a remote network (not shown) for remote authorization of an intended
     transaction. The merchant system 130 may communicate with the remote
     network via a leased line, such as a T1, D3 line, or the like. Such
     communications lines are described in a variety of texts, such as,
     "Understanding Data Communications," by Gilbert Held, which is
     incorporated herein by reference.
<BR><BR>[0055]An account number, as used herein, may include any identifier for an
     account (e.g., credit, charge debit, checking, savings, reward, loyalty,
     or the like) which may be maintained by a transaction account provider
     (e.g., payment authorization center) and which may be used to complete a
     financial transaction. A typical account number (e.g., account data) may
     be correlated to a credit or debit account, loyalty account, or rewards
     account maintained and serviced by such entities as American
     Express.RTM., Visa.RTM. and/or MasterCard.RTM. or the like. For ease in
     understanding, the present invention may be described with respect to a
     credit account. However, it should be noted that the invention is not so
     limited and other accounts permitting an exchange of goods and services
     for an account data value is contemplated to be within the scope of the
     present invention.
<BR><BR>[0056]In addition, the account number (e.g., account data) may be
     associated with any device, code, or other identifier/indicia suitably
     configured to allow the consumer to interact or communicate with the
     system, such as, for example, authorization/access code, personal
     identification number (PIN), Internet code, digital certificate,
     biometric data, and/or other identification indicia. The account number
     may be optionally located on a rewards card, charge card, credit card,
     debit card, prepaid card, telephone card, smart card, magnetic stripe
     card, bar code card, and/or the like. The account number may be
     distributed and stored in any form of plastic, electronic, magnetic,
     and/or optical device capable of transmitting or downloading data to a
     second device. A customer account number may be, for example, a
     sixteen-digit credit card number, although each credit provider has its
     own numbering system, such as the fifteen-digit numbering system used by
     American Express.RTM.. Each company's credit card numbers comply with
     that company's standardized format such that the company using a
     sixteen-digit format will generally use four spaced sets of numbers, as
     represented by the number "0000 0000 0000 0000". In a typical example,
     the first five to seven digits are reserved for processing purposes and
     identify the issuing bank, card type and, etc. In this example, the last
     sixteenth digit is used as a sum check for the sixteen-digit number. The
     intermediary eight-to-ten digits are used to uniquely identify the
     customer. The account number stored as Track 1 and Track 2 data as
     defined in ISO/IEC 7813, and further may be made unique to fob 102. In
     one exemplary embodiment, the account number may include a unique fob
     serial number and user identification number, as well as specific
     application applets. The account number may be stored in fob 102 inside a
     database 214, as described more fully below. Database 214 may be
     configured to store multiple account numbers issued to the fob 102 user
     by the same or different account providing institutions. Where the
     account data corresponds to a loyalty or rewards account, the database
     214 may be configured to store the attendant loyalty or rewards points
     data.
<BR><BR>[0057]FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of the many functional blocks of
     an exemplary fob 102 in accordance with the present invention. Fob 102
     may be an RFID fob 102 which may be presented by the user to facilitate
     an exchange of funds or points, etc., for receipt of goods or services.
     As described herein, by way of example, the fob 102 may be an RFID fob
     which may be presented for facilitating payment for goods and/or
     services.
<BR><BR>[0058]Fob 102 may include an antenna 202 for receiving an interrogation
     signal from RFID reader 104 via antenna 106 (or alternatively, via
     external antenna 108). Fob antenna 202 may be in communication with a
     transponder 114. In one exemplary embodiment, transponder 114 may be a
     13.56 MHz transponder compliant with the ISO/IEC 14443 standard, and
     antenna 202 may be of the 13 MHz variety. The transponder 114 may be in
     communication with a transponder compatible modulator/demodulator 206
     configured to receive the signal from transponder 114 and configured to
     modulate the signal into a format readable by any later connected
     circuitry. Further, modulator/demodulator 206 may be configured to format
     (e.g., demodulate) a signal received from the later connected circuitry
     in a format compatible with transponder 114 for transmitting to RFID
     reader 104 via antenna 202. For example, where transponder 114 is of the
     13.56 MHz variety, modulator/demodulator 206 may be ISO/IEC 14443-2
     compliant.
<BR><BR>[0059]Modulator/demodulator 206 may be coupled to a protocol/sequence
     controller 208 for facilitating control of the authentication of the
     signal provided by RFID reader 104, and for facilitating control of the
     sending of the fob 102 account number. In this regard, protocol/sequence
     controller 208 may be any suitable digital or logic driven circuitry
     capable of facilitating determination of the sequence of operation for
     the fob 102 inner-circuitry. For example, protocol/sequence controller
     208 may be configured to determine whether the signal provided by the
     RFID reader 104 is authenticated, and thereby providing to the RFID
     reader 104 the account number stored on fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0060]Protocol/sequence controller 208 may be further in communication
     with authentication circuitry 210 for facilitating authentication of the
     signal provided by RFID reader 104. Authentication circuitry may be
     further in communication with a non-volatile secure memory database 212.
     Secure memory database 212 may be any suitable elementary file system
     such as that defined by ISO/IEC 7816-4 or any other elementary file
     system allowing a lookup of data to be interpreted by the application on
     the chip. Database 212 may be any type of database, such as relational,
     hierarchical, object-oriented, and/or the like. Common database products
     that may be used to implement the databases include DB2 by IBM (White
     Plains, N.Y.), any of the database products available from Oracle
     Corporation (Redwood Shores, Calif.), Microsoft Access or MSSQL by
     Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.), or any other database product.
     Database 212 may be organized in any suitable manner, including as data
     tables or lookup tables. Association of certain data may be accomplished
     through any data association technique known and practiced in the art.
     For example, the association may be accomplished either manually or
     automatically. Automatic association techniques may include, for example,
     a database search, a database merge, GREP, AGREP, SQL, and/or the like.
     The association step may be accomplished by a database merge function,
     for example, using a "key field" in each of the manufacturer and retailer
     data tables. A "key field" partitions the database according to the
     high-level class of objects defined by the key field. For example, a
     certain class may be designated as a key field in both the first data
     table and the second data table, and the two data tables may then be
     merged on the basis of the class data in the key field. In this
     embodiment, the data corresponding to the key field in each of the merged
     data tables is preferably the same. However, data tables having similar,
     though not identical, data in the key fields may also be merged by using
     AGREP, for example.
<BR><BR>[0061]The data may be used by protocol/sequence controller 208 for data
     analysis and used for management and control purposes, as well as
     security purposes. Authentication circuitry may authenticate the signal
     provided by RFID reader 104 by association of the RFID signal to
     authentication keys stored on database 212. Encryption circuitry may use
     keys stored on database 212 to perform encryption and/or decryption of
     signals sent to or from the RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0062]In addition, protocol/sequence controller 208 may be in
     communication with a database 214 for storing at least a fob 102 account
     data, and a unique fob 102 identification code. Protocol/sequence
     controller 208 may be configured to retrieve the account number from
     database 214 as desired. Database 214 may be of the same configuration as
     database 212 described above. The fob account data and/or unique fob
     identification code stored on database 214 may be encrypted prior to
     storage. Thus, where protocol/sequence controller 208 retrieves the
     account data, and or unique fob identification code from database 214,
     the account number may be encrypted when being provided to RFID reader
     104. Further, the data stored on database 214 may include, for example,
     an unencrypted unique fob 102 identification code, a user identification,
     Track 1 and 2 data, as well as specific application applets. Fob 102 may
     be configured to respond to multiple interrogation frequency
     transmissions provided by RFID reader 104. That is, as described more
     fully below, RFID reader 104 may provide more than one RF interrogation
     signal. In this case, fob 102 may be configured to respond to the
     multiple frequencies by including in fob 102 one or more additional RF
     signal receiving/transmitting units 226. RF signal receiving/transmitting
     unit 226 may include an antenna 218 and transponder 220 where the antenna
     218 and transponder 220 are compatible with at least one of the
     additional RF signals provided by RFID reader 104. For example, in one
     exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may include a 134 KHz antenna 218
     configured to communicate with a 134 KHz transponder 220. In this
     exemplary configuration, an ISO/IEC 14443-2 compliant
     modulator/demodulator may not be required. Instead, the 134 KHz
     transponder may be configured to communicate directly with the
     protocol/sequence controller 208 for transmission and receipt of
     authentication and account number signals as described above.
<BR><BR>[0063]In another embodiment, fob 102 may further include a universal
     serial bus (USB) connector 132 for interfacing fob 102 to a user
     interface 134. User interface 134 may be further in communication with a
     POS device 110 via a network 136. Network 136 may be the Internet, an
     intranet, or the like as is described above with respect to network 112.
     Further, the user interface 134 may be similar in construction to any
     conventional input devices and/or computing systems aforementioned for
     permitting the system user to interact with the system. In one exemplary
     embodiment, fob 102 may be configured to facilitate online Internet
     payments. A USB converter 222 may be in communication with a USB
     connector 232 for facilitating the transfer of information between the
     modulator/demodulator 206 and USB connector 132. Alternatively, USB
     converter 222 may be in communication with protocol/sequence controller
     208 to facilitate the transfer of information between protocol/sequence
     controller 208 and USB connector 132.
<BR><BR>[0064]Where fob 102 includes a USB connector 132, fob 102 may be in
     communication with, for example, a USB port on user interface 134. The
     information retrieved from fob 102 may be compatible with credit card
     and/or smart card technology enabling usage of interactive applications
     on the Internet. No RFID reader may be required in this embodiment since
     the connection to POS device 110 may be made using a USB port on user
     interface 134 and a network 136.
<BR><BR>[0065]Fob 102 may include means for enabling activation of the fob by the
     user. In one exemplary embodiment, a switch 230 which may be operated by
     the user of the fob 102. The switch 230 on fob 102 may be used to
     selectively or inclusively activate the fob 102 for particular uses. In
     this context, the term "selectively" may mean that the switch 230 enables
     the user to place the fob 102 in a particular operational mode. For
     example, the user may place the fob 102 in a mode for enabling purchase
     of a good or of a service using a selected account number. Alternatively,
     the fob may be placed in a mode as such that the fob account number is
     provided by USB port 132 (or serial port) only and the fob transponder
     114 is disabled. In addition, the term "inclusively" may mean that the
     fob 102 is placed in an operational mode permitting the fob 102 to be
     responsive to the RF interrogation and interrogation via the USB
     connector 132. In one particular embodiment, the switch 230 may remain in
     an OFF position ensuring that one or more applications or accounts
     associated with the fob 102 are non-reactive to any commands issued by
     RFID reader 104. As used herein, the OFF position may be termed the
     "normal" position of the activation switch 230, although other normal
     positions are contemplated.
<BR><BR>[0066]In another exemplary embodiment, when the switch 230 is moved from
     the OFF position, the fob 102 may be deemed activated by the user. That
     is, the switch 230 may activate internal circuitry in fob 102 for
     permitting the fob to be responsive to RF signals (e.g., commands from
     RFID reader 104). In this way, switch 230 may facilitate control of the
     active and inactive states of the fob 102. Such control increases the
     system security by preventing inadvertent or illegal use of the fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0067]In one exemplary embodiment, switch 230 may be a simple mechanical
     device in communication with circuitry which may electrically prevent the
     fob from being powered by an RFID reader. That is, when switch 230 is in
     its normal position, switch 230 may provide a short to the fob 102
     internal circuitry, preventing fob 102 from being responsive to
     interrogation by RF or via the USB connector 230. In this arrangement,
     the switch 230 may be, for example, a "normally closed" (NC) configured
     switch, which may be electrically connected to the antenna 202 at the
     interface of the antenna 202 and the transponder 114. The switch 230 may
     be depressed, which may open the switch 230 fully activating the antenna
     202.
<BR><BR>[0068]In yet another exemplary embodiment, the fob 102 may include a
     biometric sensor and biometric membrane configured to operate as switch
     230 and activate the fob 102 when provided biometric signal from the fob
     102 user. Such biometric signal may be the digital reading of a
     fingerprint, thumbprint, or the like. Typically, where biometric
     circuitry is used, the biometric circuitry may be powered by an internal
     voltage source (e.g., battery). In this case, the switch may not be a
     simple mechanical device, but a switch which is powered. In yet another
     exemplary embodiment, switch 230 may be battery powered though no
     biometric circuitry is present in the fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0069]In yet another embodiment, the switch 230 may be a logic switch.
     Where switch 230 is a logic switch the switch 230 control software may be
     read from the sequence controller 208 to selectively control the
     activation of the various fob 102 components.
<BR><BR>[0070]FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of an RFID reader 104
     in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. RFID
     reader 104 includes, for example, an antenna 106 coupled to a RF module
     302, which is further coupled to a control module 304. In addition, RFID
     reader 104 may include an antenna 108 positioned remotely from the RFID
     reader 104 and coupled to RFID reader 104 via a suitable cable 120, or
     other wire or wireless connection.
<BR><BR>[0071]RF module 302 and antenna 106 may be suitably configured to
     facilitate communication with fob 102. Where fob 102 is formatted to
     receive a signal at a particular RF frequency, RF module 302 may be
     configured to provide an interrogation signal at that same frequency. For
     example, in one exemplary embodiment, fob 102 may be configured to
     respond to an interrogation signal of about 13.56 MHz. In this case, RFID
     antenna 106 may be 13 MHz and may be configured to transmit an
     interrogation signal of about 13.56 MHz. That is, fob 102 may be
     configured to include a first and second RF module (e.g., transponder)
     where the first module may operate using a 134 kHz frequency and the
     second RF module may operate using a 13.56 MHz frequency. The RFID reader
     104 may include two receivers which may operate using the 134 kHz
     frequency, the 13.56 MHz frequency or both. When the reader 104 is
     operating at 134 kHz frequency, only operation with the 134 kHz module on
     the fob 102 may be possible. When the reader 104 is operating at the
     13.56 MHz frequency, only operation with the 13.56 MHz module on the fob
     102 may be possible. Where the reader 104 supports both a 134 kHz
     frequency and a 13.56 MHz RF module, the fob 102 may receive both signals
     from the reader 104. In this case, the fob 102 may be configured to
     prioritize selection of the one or the other frequency and reject the
     remaining frequency. Alternatively, the reader 104 may receive signals at
     both frequencies from the fob upon interrogation. In this case, the
     reader 104 may be configured to prioritize selection of one or the other
     frequency and reject the remaining frequency.
<BR><BR>[0072]Further, protocol/sequence controller 314 may include an optional
     feedback function for notifying the user of the status of a particular
     transaction. For example, the optional feedback may be in the form of an
     LED, LED screen and/or other visual display which is configured to light
     up or display a static, scrolling, flashing and/or other message and/or
     signal to inform the fob 102 user that the transaction is initiated
     (e.g., fob is being interrogated), the fob is valid (e.g., fob is
     authenticated), transaction is being processed, (e.g., fob account number
     is being read by RFID reader) and/or the transaction is accepted or
     denied (e.g., transaction approved or disapproved). Such an optional
     feedback may or may not be accompanied by an audible indicator (or may
     present the audible indicator singly) for informing the fob 102 user of
     the transaction status. The audible feedback may be a simple tone,
     multiple tones, musical indicator, and/or voice indicator configured to
     signify when the fob 102 is being interrogated, the transaction status,
     or the like.
<BR><BR>[0073]RFID antenna 106 may be in communication with a transponder 306 for
     transmitting an interrogation signal and receiving at least one of an
     authentication request signal and/or an account data from fob 102.
     Transponder 306 may be of similar description as transponder 114 of FIG.
     2. In particular, transponder 306 may be configured to send and/or
     receive RF signals in a format compatible with antenna 202 in similar
     manner as was described with respect to fob transponder 114. For example,
     where transponder 306 is 13.56 MHz RF rated antenna 202 may be 13.56 MHz
     compatible. Similarly, where transponder 306 is ISO/IEC 14443 rated,
     antenna 106 may be ISO/IEC 14443 compatible.
<BR><BR>[0074]RF module 302 may include, for example, transponder 306 in
     communication with authentication circuitry 308 which may be in
     communication with a secure database 310. Authentication circuitry 308
     and database 310 may be of similar description and operation as described
     with respect to authentication circuitry 210 and secure memory database
     212 of FIG. 2. For example, database 310 may store data corresponding to
     the fob 102 which are authorized to transact business over system 100.
     Database 310 may additionally store RFID reader 104 identifying
     information for providing to fob 102 for use in authenticating whether
     RFID reader 104 is authorized to be provided the fob account number
     stored on fob database 214.
<BR><BR>[0075]Authentication circuitry 308 may be of similar description and
     operation as authentication circuitry 210. That is, authentication
     circuitry 308 may be configured to authenticate the signal provided by
     fob 102 in similar manner that authentication circuitry 210 may be
     configured to authenticate the signal provided by RFID reader 104. As is
     described more fully below, fob 102 and RFID reader 104 engage in mutual
     authentication. In this context, "mutual authentication" may mean that
     operation of the system 100 may not take place until fob 102
     authenticates the signal from RFID reader 104, and RFID reader 104
     authenticates the signal from fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0076]FIG. 4 is a flowchart of an exemplary authentication process in
     accordance with the present invention. The authentication process is
     depicted as one-sided. That is, the flowchart depicts the process of the
     RFID reader 104 authenticating the fob 102, although similar steps may be
     followed in the instance that fob 102 authenticates RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0077]As noted, database 212 may store security keys for encrypting or
     decrypting signals received from RFID reader 104. In an exemplary
     authentication process, where RFID reader 104 is authenticating fob 102,
     RFID reader 104 may provide an interrogation signal to fob 102 (step
     402). The interrogation signal may include a random code generated by the
     RFID reader authentication circuit 210, which is provided to the fob 102
     and which is encrypted using an unique encryption key corresponding to
     the fob 102 unique identification code. For example, the
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may provide a command to activate the
     authentication circuitry 308. Authentication circuitry 308 may provide
     from database 310 a fob interrogation signal including a random number as
     a part of the authentication code generated for each authentication
     signal. The authentication code may be an alphanumeric code which is
     recognizable (e.g., readable) by the RFID reader 104 and the fob 102. The
     authentication code may be provided to the fob 102 via the RFID RF
     interface 306 and antenna 106 (or alternatively antenna 108).
<BR><BR>[0078]Fob 102 receives the interrogation signal (step 404). The
     interrogation signal including the authorization code may be received at
     the RF interface 114 via antenna 202. Once the fob 102 is activated, the
     interrogation signal including the authorization code may be provided to
     the modulator/demodulator circuit 206 where the signal may be demodulated
     prior to providing the signal to protocol/sequence controller 208.
     Protocol/sequence controller 208 may recognize the interrogation signal
     as a request for authentication of the fob 102, and provide the
     authentication code to authentication circuit 210. The fob 102 may then
     encrypt the authentication code (step 406). In particular, encryption may
     be done by authentication circuit 210, which may receive the
     authentication code and encrypt the code prior to providing the encrypted
     authentication code to protocol/sequence controller 208. Fob 102 may then
     provide the encrypted authentication code to the RFID reader 104 (step
     408). That is, the encrypted authentication code may be provided to the
     RFID reader 104 via modulator/demodulator circuit 206, RF interface 114
     (e.g., transponder 114) and antenna 202.
<BR><BR>[0079]RFID reader 104 may then receive the encrypted authentication code
     and decryption it (step 410). That is, the encrypted authentication code
     may be received at antenna 106 and RF interface 306 and may be provided
     to authentication circuit 308. Authentication circuit 308 may be provided
     a security authentication key (e.g., transponder system decryption key)
     from database 310. The authentication circuit may use the authentication
     key to decrypt (e.g., unlock) the encrypted authorization code. The
     authentication key may be provided to the authentication circuit based on
     the fob 102 unique identification code. For example, the encrypted
     authentication code may be provided along with the unique fob 102
     identification code. The authentication circuit may receive the fob 102
     unique identification code and retrieve from the database 310 a
     transponder system decryption key correlative to the unique fob 102
     identification code for use in decrypting the encrypted authentication
     code.
<BR><BR>[0080]Once the authentication code is decrypted, the decrypted
     authentication code is compared to the authentication code provided by
     the RFID reader 104 at step 402 (step 412) to verify its authenticity. If
     the decrypted authorization code is not readable (e.g., recognizable) by
     the authentication circuit 308, the fob 102 is deemed to be unauthorized
     (e.g., unverified) (step 416) and the operation of system 100 is
     terminated (step 418). Contrarily, if the decrypted authorization code is
     recognizable (e.g., verified) by the fob 102, the decrypted authorization
     code is deemed to be authenticated (step 412), and the transaction is
     allowed to proceed (step 414). In one particular embodiment, the
     proceeding transaction may mean that the fob 102 may authenticate the
     RFID reader 104 prior to the RFID reader 104 authenticating fob 102,
     although, it should be apparent that the RFID reader 104 may authenticate
     the fob 102 prior to the fob 102 authenticating the RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0081]It should be noted that in an exemplary verification process, the
     authorization circuit 308 may determine whether the unlocked
     authorization code is identical to the authorization code provided in
     step 402. If the codes are not identical then the fob 102 is not
     authorized to access system 100. Although, the verification process is
     described with respect to identicality, identicality is not required. For
     example, authentication circuit 308 may verify the decrypted code through
     any protocol, steps, or process for determining whether the decrypted
     code corresponds to an authorized fob 102.
<BR><BR>[0082]Authentication circuitry 308 may additionally be in communication
     with a protocol/sequence controller 314 of similar operation and
     description as protocol/sequence controller 208 of FIG. 2. That is,
     protocol/sequence device controller 314 may be configured to determine
     the order of operation of the RFID reader 104 components. For example,
     FIG. 5 illustrates and exemplary decision process under which
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may operate. Protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the different components of RFID reader 104
     based on whether a fob 102 is present (step 502). For example, if a fob
     102 is not present, then protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the
     RFID reader 104 to provide an uninterrupted interrogation signal (step
     504). That is, the protocol/sequence controller may command the
     authentication circuit 308 to provide an uninterrupted interrogation
     signal until the presence of a fob 102 is realized. If a fob 102 is
     present, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID reader
     104 to authenticate the fob 102 (step 506).
<BR><BR>[0083]As noted above, authentication may mean that the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the authentication circuit 308 to provide fob
     102 with an authorization code. If a response is received from fob 102,
     protocol/sequence controller may determine if the response is a response
     to the RFID reader 104 provided authentication code, or if the response
     is a signal requiring authentication (step 508). If the signal requires
     <B><I>authentication, then the protocol</I></B>/sequence controller 314 may activate
     the authentication circuit as described above (step 506). On the other
     hand, if the fob 102 signal is a response to the provided authentication
     code, then the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID
     reader 104 to retrieve the appropriate security key for enabling
     recognition of the signal (step 510). That is, the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the authentication circuit 308 to retrieve
     from database 310 a security key (e.g., transponder system decryption
     key), unlock the signal, and compare the signal to the signal provided by
     the RFID reader 104 in the authentication process (e.g., step 506). If
     the signal is recognized, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may
     determine that the fob 102 is authorized to access the system 100. If the
     signal is not recognized, then the fob 102 is considered not authorized.
     In which case, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may command the RFID
     controller to interrogate for authorized fobs (step 504).
<BR><BR>[0084]Once the protocol/sequence controller determines that the fob 102 is
     authorized, the protocol/sequence controller 314 may seek to determine if
     additional signals are being sent by fob 102 (step 514). If no additional
     signal is provided by fob 102, then the protocol/sequence controller 314
     may provide all the components of RFID reader 104 to remain idle until
     such time as a signal is provided (step 516). Contrarily, where an
     additional fob 102 signal is provided, the protocol/sequence controller
     314 may determine if the fob 102 is requesting access to the merchant
     point of sale terminal 110 (e.g., POS device) or if the fob 102 is
     attempting to interrogate the RFID reader 104 for return (e.g., mutual)
     authorization (step 518). Where the fob 102 is requesting access to a
     merchant point of sale terminal 110, the protocol/sequence controller 314
     may command the RFID reader 104 to open communications with the point of
     sale terminal 110 (step 524). In particular, the protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may command the point of sale terminal communications
     interface 312 to become active, permitting transfer of data between the
     RFID reader 104 and the merchant point of sale terminal 110.
<BR><BR>[0085]On the other hand, if the protocol/sequence controller determines
     that the fob 102 signal is a mutual interrogation signal, then the
     protocol/sequence controller may command the RFID reader 104 to encrypt
     the signal (step 520). The protocol/sequence controller 314 may command
     the encryption authentication circuit 318 to retrieve from database 320
     the appropriate encryption key in response to the fob 102 mutual
     interrogation signal. The protocol/sequence controller 314 may then
     command the RFID reader 104 to provide the encrypted mutual interrogation
     signal to the fob 102. The protocol/sequence controller 314 may command
     the authentication circuit 318 to provide an encrypted mutual
     interrogation signal for the fob 102 to mutually authenticate. Fob 102
     may then receive the encrypted mutual interrogation signal and retrieve
     from authentication circuitry 212 an RFID reader decryption key.
<BR><BR>[0086]Although an exemplary decision process of protocol/sequence
     controller 314 is described, it should be understood that a similar
     decision process may be undertaken by protocol/sequence controller 208 in
     controlling the components of fob 102. Indeed, as described above,
     protocol/sequence controller 314 may have similar operation and design as
     protocol/sequence controller 208. In addition, to the above,
     protocol/sequence controllers 208 and 314 may incorporate in the decision
     process appropriate commands for enabling USB interfaces 222 and 316,
     when the corresponding device is so connected.
<BR><BR>[0087]Encryption/decryption component 318 may be further in communication
     with a secure account number database 320 which stores the security keys
     necessary for decrypting the encrypted fob account number. Upon
     appropriate request from protocol/sequence controller 314,
     encryption/decryption component (e.g., circuitry 318) may retrieve the
     appropriate security key, decrypt the fob account number and forward the
     decrypted account number to protocol sequence controller 314 in any
     format readable by any later connected POS device 110. In one exemplary
     embodiment, the account number may be forwarded in a conventional
     magnetic stripe format compatible with the ISO/IEC 7813 standard. Upon
     receiving the account number in magnetic stripe format, protocol/sequence
     controller 314 may forward the account number to POS device 110 via a
     communications interface 312 and data link 122, as best shown in FIG. 1.
     POS device 110 may receive the decrypted account number and forward the
     magnetic stripe formatted account number to a merchant network 112 for
     processing under the merchant's business as usual standard. In this way,
     the present invention eliminates the need of a third-party server.
     Further, where the POS device 110 receives a response from network 112
     (e.g., transaction authorized or denied), protocol/sequence controller
     314 may provide the network response to the RF module 302 for optically
     and/or audibly communicating the response to the fob 102 user.
<BR><BR>[0088]RFID reader 104 may additionally include a USB interface 316, in
     communication with the protocol/sequence controller 314. In one
     embodiment, the USB interface may be a RS22 serial data interface.
     Alternatively, the RFID reader 104 may include a serial interface such
     as, for example, a RS232 interface in communication with the
     protocol/sequence controller 314. The USB connector 316 may be in
     communication with a personalization system 116 (shown in FIG. 1B) for
     initializing RFID reader 104 to system 100 application parameters. That
     is, prior to operation of system 100, RFID reader 104 may be in
     communication with personalization system 116 for populating database 310
     with a listing of security keys belonging to authorized fobs 102, and for
     populating database 320 with the security keys to decrypt the fob 102
     account numbers placing the account numbers in ISO/IEC 7813 format. In
     this way, RFID reader 104 may be populated with a unique identifier
     (e.g., serial number) which may be used by fob authentication circuitry
     210 to determine if RFID reader 104 is authorized to receive a fob 102
     encrypted account number.
<BR><BR>[0089]FIG. 1B illustrates an exemplary personalization system 100B, in
     accordance with the present invention. In general, typical
     personalization system 100B may be any system for initializing the RFID
     reader 104 and fob 102 for use in system 100A. With reference to FIG. 1B,
     the similar personalization process for fob 102 may be illustrated. For
     example, personalization system 116 may be in communication with fob 102
     via RF ISO 14443 interface 114 for populating fob database 212 with the
     security keys for facilitating authentication of the unique RFID reader
     104 identifier. In addition, personalization system 116 may populate on
     database 212 a unique fob 102 identifier for use by RFID reader 104 in
     determining whether fob 102 is authorized to access system 100.
     Personalization system 116 may populate (e.g., inject) the encrypted fob
     102 account number into fob database 214 for later providing to an
     authenticated RFID reader 104.
<BR><BR>[0090]In one exemplary embodiment, personalization system 116 may include
     any standard computing system as described above. For example,
     personalization system 116 may include a standard personal computer
     containing a hardware security module operable using any conventional
     graphic user interface. Prior to populating the security key information
     account number and unique identifying information into the fob 102 or
     RFID reader 104, the hardware security module may authenticate the fob
     102 and RFID reader 104 to verify that the components are authorized to
     receive the secure information.
<BR><BR>[0091]FIGS. 6A-B illustrate an exemplary flowchart of a personalization
     procedure which may be used to personalize fob 102 and/or RFID reader
     104. Although the following description discusses mainly personalization
     of fob 102, RFID reader 104 may be personalized using a similar process.
     The personalization process, which occurs between the personalization
     system 116 and the device to be personalized (e.g., fob 102 or RFID
     reader 104), may begin, for example at step 602. Mutual authentication
     may occur between the personalization system 116 and the device to be
     authenticated in much the same manner as was described above with regard
     to fob 102 mutually authenticating with RFID reader 104. That is,
     personalization system 116 may transmit a personalization system 116
     identifier to the device to be authenticated which is compared by the
     device authentication circuitry 210, 308 against personalization system
     identifiers stored in the device database 212, 310. Where a match does
     not occur (step 604), the personalization process may be aborted (step
     612). Where a match occurs (step 604), the personalization system may
     prepare a personalization file to be provided to the device to be
     personalized (step 606). If the personalization system is operated
     manually, the personalization file may be entered into the
     personalization system 116 using any suitable system interface such as,
     for example, a keyboard (step 606). Where the personalization system 116
     operator elects to delay the preparation of the personalization files,
     the system 116 may abort the personalization process (step 610). In this
     context, the personalization file may include the unique fob 102 or RFID
     reader 104 identifier, security key for loading into database 212 and
     310, and/or security keys for decrypting a fob account number which may
     be loaded in database 320.
<BR><BR>[0092]Fob 102 may be personalized by direct connection to the
     personalization system 116 via RF ISO/IEC 14443 interface 114, or the fob
     102 may be personalized using RFID reader 104. Personalization system 116
     and RFID reader 104 may engage in mutual authentication and RFID reader
     104 may be configured to transmit the fob personalization file to fob 102
     via RF. Once the fob 102 is presented to RFID reader 104 (steps 608, 614)
     for personalization, fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may engage in mutual
     authentication (step 614). Where the fob 102 is not presented to the RFID
     reader 104 for personalization, the personalization process may be
     aborted (step 610).
<BR><BR>[0093]If the fob 102 is detected, the personalization system 116 may
     create as a part of the personalization file, a unique identifier for
     providing to the fob 102 (step 616). The identifier is unique in that one
     identifier may be given only to a single fob. That is, no other fob may
     have that same identifier. The fob may then be configured and loaded with
     that identifier (step 618).
<BR><BR>[0094]The encrypted fob 102 account number may be populated into fob 102
     in the same manner as is described with respect to the fob 102 unique
     identifier. That is, personalization system 116 may pre-encrypt the
     account data (step 640) and inject the encrypted account into fob
     database 214 (step 622). The encrypted account data may be loaded (e.g.,
     injected) into the fob 102 using RFID reader 104 as discussed above.
<BR><BR>[0095]Once the personalization file is populated into the fob 102, the
     populated information is irreversibly locked to prevent alteration,
     unauthorized reading and/or unauthorized access (step 624).
     Personalization system 116 may then create a log of the personalization
     file information for later access and analysis by the personalization
     system 116 user (step 626).
<BR><BR>[0096]It should be noted that in the event the personalization process is
     compromised or interrupted (step 628), the personalization system 116 may
     send a security alert to the user (step 630) and the personalization
     process may be aborted (step 612). On the other hand, where no such
     compromising or interruption exists, the personalization system 116 may
     be prepared to begin initialization on a second device to be personalized
     (step 632).
<BR><BR>[0097]FIGS. 7A-B illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a
     personalization process which may be used to personalize RFID reader 104.
     RFID reader 104 may be in communication with a personalization system 116
     via an RFID reader USB connection 316 (step 702). Once connected,
     personalization system 116 may establish communications with the RFID
     reader 104 and RFID reader 104 may provide personalization system 116 any
     RFID reader 104 identification data presently stored on the RFID reader
     104 (step 704). In accordance with step 708, where the RFID reader 104 is
     being personalized for the first time (step 706) the RFID reader 104 and
     the personalization system 116 may engage in mutual authentication as
     described above with respect to FIGS. 6A-B. After the mutual
     authentication is complete, personalization system 116 may verify that
     RFID reader 104 is properly manufactured or configured to operate within
     system 100. The verification may include evaluating the operation of the
     RFID reader 104 by determining if the RFID reader will accept
     predetermined default settings. That is, the personalization system 116
     may then provide the RFID reader 104 a set of default settings (step 708)
     and determine if the RFID reader 104 accepts those settings (step 712).
     If RFID reader 104 does not accept the default settings, personalization
     system 116 may abort the personalization process (step 714).
<BR><BR>[0098]If the personalization system 116 determines that the
     personalization process is not the first personalization process
     undertaken by the RFID reader 104 (step 706), personalization system 116
     and RFID reader 104 may engage in a mutual authentication process using
     the existing security keys already stored on RFID reader 104 (step 710).
     If authentication is unsuccessful (step 712), the personalization system
     116 may abort the personalization process (step 714).
<BR><BR>[0099]Where the personalization system 116 and the RFID reader 104
     successfully mutually authenticate, the personalization system 116 may
     update the RFID reader 104 security keys (step 716). Updating the
     security keys may take place at any time as determined by a system 100
     manager. The updating may take place as part of a routine maintenance or
     merely to install current security key data. The updating may be
     performed by downloading firmware into RFID reader 104 (step 718). In the
     event that the personalization system 116 determines in step 706 that the
     RFID reader 104 is undergoing an initial personalization, the firmware
     may be loaded into the RFID reader 104 for the first time. In this
     context, "firmware" may include any file which enables the RFID reader
     102 to operate under system 100 guidelines. For example, such guidelines
     may be directed toward the operation of RFID reader protocol/sequence
     controller 314.
<BR><BR>[0100]Personalization system 116 may then determine if the personalization
     keys (e.g., security keys, decryption keys, RFID identifier) need to be
     updated or if the RFID reader 104 needs to have an initial installation
     of the personalization keys (step 720). If so, then personalization
     system 116 may download the personalization keys as appropriate (step
     722).
<BR><BR>[0101]Personalization system 116 may then check the RFID reader 104 to
     determine if the fob 102 identifiers and corresponding security keys
     should be updated or initially loaded (step 724). If no updating is
     necessary the personalization system 116 may end the personalization
     procedure (step 732). Contrarily, if the personalization system 116
     determines that the fob 102 identifiers and corresponding keys need to be
     updated or installed, the personalization system 116 may download the
     information onto RFID reader 104 (step 726). The information (e.g., fob
     security keys and identifiers) may be downloaded in an encrypted format
     and the RFID reader 104 may store the information in the RFID reader
     database 310 as appropriate (step 728). The personalization system 116
     may then create or update a status log cataloging for later use and
     analysis by the personalization system 116 user (step 730). Upon updating
     the status log, the personalization process may be terminated (step 732).
<BR><BR>[0102]It should be noted that, in some instances it may be necessary to
     repersonalize the RFID reader in similar manner as described above. In
     that instance, the personalization process described in FIGS. 7A and 7B
     may be repeated.
<BR><BR>[0103]FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for the operation of
     system 100A. The operation may be understood with reference to FIG. 1A,
     which depicts the elements of system 100A which may be used in an
     exemplary transaction. The process is initiated when a customer desires
     to present a fob 102 for payment (step 802). Upon presentation of the fob
     102, the merchant initiates the RF payment procedure via an RFID reader
     104 (step 804). In particular, the RFID reader sends out an interrogation
     signal to scan for the presence of fob 102 (step 806). The RF signal may
     be provided via the RFID reader antenna 106 or optionally via an external
     antenna 108. The customer then may present the fob 102 for payment (step
     808) and the fob 102 is activated by the RF interrogation signal
     provided.
<BR><BR>[0104]The fob 102 and the RFID reader 104 may then engage in mutual
     authentication (step 810). Where the mutual authentication is
     unsuccessful, an error message may be provided to the customer via the
     RFID optical and/or audible indicator (step 814) and the transaction may
     be aborted (step 816). Where the mutual authentication is successful
     (step 814), the RFID reader 104 may provide the customer with an
     appropriate optical and/or audible message (e.g., "transaction
     processing" or "wait") (step 818). The fob protocol/sequence controller
     208 may then retrieve from database 214 an encrypted fob account number
     and provide the encrypted account number to the RFID reader 104 (step
     820).
<BR><BR>[0105]The RFID reader 104 may then decrypt the account number and convert
     the account number into magnetic stripe (ISO/IEC 7813) format (step 822)
     and provide the unencrypted account number to the merchant system 130
     (step 828). In particular, the account number may be provided to the POS
     110 device for transmission to the merchant network 112 for processing.
     Exemplary processing methods according to the present invention are
     discussed with respect to FIGS. 10-13, shown below. Upon processing, the
     POS device 110 may then send an optical and/or audible transaction status
     message to the RFID reader 104 (step 830) for communication to the
     customer (step 832).
<BR><BR>[0106]The methods for processing the transactions may include one of
     several formats as required by the fob issuer. For example, one
     processing method may include processing the transaction under a
     preloaded fob format wherein a payment value (e.g., monetary value,
     reward points value, barter points value, etc.) may be preloaded into an
     preloaded value account or data file prior to permitting usage of the
     fob. In this way, the user may be permitted to set aside a payment amount
     for transactions for goods and services using the fob. During processing
     of the transaction, approval of the transaction may involve comparing the
     transaction amount to the amount stored (or remaining) in the preloaded
     value data file. Comparison may be made by a preloaded value processing
     system wherein the preloaded value processing system may compare the
     transaction amount to be processed to the preload value data file. Where
     the transaction amount exceeds the amount stored in the preloaded value
     account, the preloaded value processing system may deny authorization for
     completion of the transaction. Contrarily, where the transaction amount
     does not exceed the amount stored in the preloaded value data file
     account the preloaded value processing system may provide for
     authorization of the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0107]An exemplary preloaded value processing system 1000 is shown with
     respect to FIG. 10. Preloaded value processing system 1000 may include a
     fob 102 including a transponder 114, which is in communication with a
     merchant system 130 via an RFID reader 104 or a computer interface 134 as
     is described with respect to FIG. 1A. The merchant system may be in
     communication with an issuer system 1010, where the issuer system 1010
     may be maintained by any entity (e.g., financial institution, American
     Express, Visa and/or MasterCard, etc.) which permits the fob 102 user to
     store a preload value in a preloaded value account (e.g., data file)
     maintained on an issuer database 1012 of similar construction as database
     212. The issuer system 1000 may further include one or more process
     servers for processing a fob transaction. As shown, a POS device 110
     (included in merchant system 130) may be in communication with an issuer
     account server (IAS) 1014 for receiving the fob account information from
     POS device 110. IAS 1014 may be in further communication with a preloaded
     value authorization server (PLAS) 1016 for processing transactions
     involving a preloaded value fob. The PLAS 1016 may be in further
     communication with an issuer database 1012 for retrieving funds from the
     preloaded value data file (not shown) which are necessary for satisfying
     the preloaded fob or merchant transaction request.
<BR><BR>[0108]As used herein, the term "issuer" or "account provider" may refer to
     any entity facilitating payment of a transaction using a fob, and which
     included systems permitting payment using at least one of a preloaded and
     non-preloaded fob. Typical issuers maybe American Express, MasterCard,
     Visa, Discover, and the like. In the preloaded value processing context,
     an exchange value (e.g., money, rewards points, barter points, etc.) may
     be stored in a preloaded value data file for use in completing a
     requested transaction. The exchange value may not be stored on the fob
     itself. Further, the preloaded value data file may be debited the amount
     of the transaction requiring the preloaded value data file to be
     replenished. As described more fully below, the preloaded value system
     platform may be used to complete "direct link" transactions. In which
     case, the preloaded value account may function as a place holder,
     perpetually storing a zero value.
<BR><BR>[0109]The preloaded value data file may be any conventional data file
     configuration for storing a value (e.g., monetary, rewards points, barter
     points, etc.) which may be exchanged for goods or services. In that
     regard, the preloaded value data file may have any configuration as
     determined by the issuer system 1010.
<BR><BR>[0110]In exemplary operation, a fob identifying information (e.g., account
     number or fob marker) may be provided to the POS device 110 in similar
     manner as was discussed with respect to FIG. 1A. That is, the fob 102 may
     be presented to the merchant system 130 via an RFID reader 104 or a
     computer interface 134, which may provide the fob identifying information
     in Track 1 or Track 2 format. A POS device 110 included in the merchant
     system 130 may receive the fob 102 identifying information and provide
     the fob 102 identifying information along with the transaction
     identifying information (e.g., amount, quantity, merchant identification,
     etc.) to the issuer system 1010 for authorization. The merchant system
     130 may additionally include a merchant system marker or identifier for
     indicating a merchant system identity. The merchant system 130 may
     combine the fob 102 identifying information, the merchant identifying
     information, or the transaction identifying information, or any
     combination thereof, into a merchant transaction request for providing to
     the issuer system 1010.
<BR><BR>[0111]The IAS 1014 may receive the transaction and fob identifying
     information (or merchant transaction request) and recognize that the
     transaction is being requested relative to a preloaded value account
     associated with a preloaded fob. That is, the IAS 1014 may recognize that
     the user has presented a preloaded fob 102 for payment. Recognition of
     the fob 102 as a preloaded fob may mean that the fob identifying
     information includes a marker or identifier indicating that the fob is
     associated with a preloaded value data file. Upon recognition of the
     marker, the IAS 1014 may forward transaction and fob identifying
     information to the PLAS 1016 for processing. PLAS 1016 may compare the
     transaction amount to the value stored or remaining in the preloaded
     value to determine if authorization should be granted or denied. Where
     the transaction amount exceeds the value stored in the preloaded value
     data file the PLAS 1016 may forward a transaction denied message to the
     IAS 1014 for providing to the merchant system 130. Alternatively, where
     the transaction amount is less than or equal to the value stored in the
     preload value data file the PLAS 1016 may deduct from the preloaded value
     data file the necessary amount for satisfaction of the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0112]As noted above, in one exemplary embodiment of the present
     invention, the PLAS 1016 may provide a transaction denied message to the
     IAS 1014 where the amount stored in the preloaded value account is less
     than required for satisfying the merchant or fob transaction request. In
     this instance, where the preloaded value falls below a predetermined
     minimum level (e.g., minimum depletion level), it may be necessary for
     the fob user to reload the preloaded value data file. Reloading of the
     preloaded value account may take place manually (e.g., by the fob user
     telephonically or online) or may take place automatically when the value
     stored in the preloaded value data file is depleted to a predefined
     level. Where the reloading is done automatically, reloading may occur
     under rules established by the fob issuer or owner. For example,
     reloading may occur at preselected time limits, when the reserve is below
     a predetermined amount, until a maximum number of reloads in a
     predetermined time period has occurred or until a maximum reload amount
     is reached in a predetermined time period.
<BR><BR>[0113]FIG. 11B depicts an exemplary preloading and reloading processes
     which may be performed in accordance with the present invention. The
     preloading and reloading processes may be preformed using one or more
     servers (e.g., PLAS 1016) in communication with a funding source 1104.
     Although the processes are demonstrated using a PLAS 1016, it is
     contemplated that any server for establishing and managing data files may
     be used. However, to facilitate further understanding of the invention,
     the preloading and reloading aspects of the invention are described with
     reference to PLAS 1016.
<BR><BR>[0114]PLAS 1016 may be used to establish on the server or on a database
     (e.g., database 1012) a preloaded value account (e.g., data file) (1106).
     The preload value account may be funded or maintained by a fob issuer
     which may establish a credit, charge, debit, rewards value account, etc.
     in connection with a charge or credit card (e.g., Visa, MasterCard,
     American Express, Discover, etc.), debit or direct debit authorization
     (DDA) system.
<BR><BR>[0115]The preloaded value account may be established to at least a
     predetermined minimum preload amount or value (e.g., minimum preload
     level) as determined by the account provider and/or the fob user or
     owner. In this context, the predetermined minimum value (e.g., minimum
     preload value) required to establish the preloaded value account may vary
     with respect to a particular fob user. The preloaded value account may be
     loaded (e.g., preloaded or reloaded) from funds received from one of a
     funding source account 1104 (American Express, Visa, MasterCard,
     Discover, etc.). That is, the PLAS 1016 may communicate with the funding
     source 1104 to obtain funds or value for loading or reloading the
     preloaded value account (1108).
<BR><BR>[0116]FIG. 11B shows and exemplary reloading process in accordance with
     the invention. During operation, a consumer may present to a merchant
     system 130 the prepaid fob 102 for purchasing goods or services (1110).
     The preloaded value account is then depleted the value amount paid to the
     merchant system 130. The process for purchasing goods may be repeated
     until the value stored in the preloaded value account equals or is less
     than a minimum level balance (e.g., minimum depletion level). The minimum
     depletion level may be predetermined by the fob user or fob issuer, and
     may be the minimum value permitted to be stored in the preloaded value
     account before the file is to be reloaded.
<BR><BR>[0117]Once the preloaded value data is depleted such that the minimum
     depletion level is reached, the PLAS 1016 may trigger an automatic reload
     to reload the preloaded value account from funds retrieved from the
     funding source 1104 (1112). The amount of funds retrieved may be
     sufficient for loading the preloaded value account to the minimum amount
     described above or to some other predetermined reload value. In one
     exemplary embodiment, the PLAS 1016 may trigger automatic reloading where
     a predetermined minimum depletion level (e.g., "minimum level balance")
     is reached. That is, the preloaded value account may not be entirely
     depleted to zero value before automatic reloading occurs. In this
     instance, the PLAS 1016 may charge the funding necessary for automatic
     reloading against the available funds at funding source 1104. In another
     exemplary embodiment the automatic reloading may occur where the
     transaction exceeds the amount stored in or remaining in the preloaded
     value account. In this way, the preloaded value account may be restored
     to an amount necessary for completion of the transaction. For example,
     where automatic reloading restores the preloaded value account to a value
     suitable for transaction completion, the preloaded value account may be
     automatically reloaded prior to processing the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0118]In another exemplary embodiment, automatic reloading may occur based
     on different user or issuer automatic reload criteria. Other automatic
     reload criteria may include, but are not limited to, reloading until a
     defined maximum load amount in a defined time period is reached,
     reloading at a selected reoccurring time interval (e.g., once a month),
     reloading as permitted until a defined maximum number of reloads in a
     specified time period is reached, or reloading until a defined maximum
     reload amount is reached in a specified time period, etc. In some
     instances, reloading may be done manually, such as, for example, when the
     fob user contacts the issuer telephonically or via user interface to
     provide a specified funding criteria for use in reloading the preloaded
     value account.
<BR><BR>[0119]In yet another exemplary embodiment, the preloaded value transaction
     processing system may permit approval of a transaction where the
     transaction value exceeds the preloaded value amount stored in the
     preloaded value account. That is, the preloaded fob may be used for
     purchases exceeding the preloaded value amount provided that the charge
     submitted by the merchant is less than or equal to the maximum reload
     amount permitted plus the amount stored on the card at the time the
     charge is submitted.
<BR><BR>[0120]In another exemplary embodiment, the preloaded value system may
     approve transactions based on a particular merchants transaction
     processing protocol. Where the issuer has reviewed and/or approved a
     merchant's transaction processing method, the system may take the method
     in consideration in determining whether to approve a merchant's
     transaction request. For example, a merchant's transaction processing
     method may include the merchant submitting transaction requests which
     exceed the preloaded value amount, but the actual charge may be less than
     or equal to the preloaded value amount. Under this transaction processing
     method a merchant, such as, for example, a gasoline merchant, may seek
     pre-approval of an anticipated gasoline fueling amount. Neither the
     consumer nor the merchant may know the final value of the purchase,
     especially, for example, where the consumer decides to fill his
     automobile gas tank or purchase non-fuel items. Thus, the merchant may
     submit a transaction request which may be higher than the final amount of
     the transaction. In this instance, the preloaded value transaction
     processing system may still be configured to approve the transaction
     request. The processing system may recognize that a transaction came from
     a particular merchant and institute a predetermined approval protocol
     correlative to that merchant, since the approval protocol may include
     information that the merchant is sending a transaction request exceeding
     the actual charge.
<BR><BR>[0121]The transaction processing system may use any one of the acceptable
     techniques for identifying merchants, such as recognition of the merchant
     ID, or a marker appended to the transaction, etc. The processing system
     may correlate the merchant ID with a merchant protocol for requesting a
     transaction approval of an amount greater than the preloaded value (or
     reload value), and approve the merchant request accordingly.
<BR><BR>[0122]In accordance with an alternate exemplary embodiment of a preloaded
     value processing system 1000, upon receiving the transaction request from
     the IAS 1014, the PLAS 1016 may evaluate the transaction request based
     upon several risk criteria established by the issuer. If all the criteria
     are successfully met, then the PLAS 1016 may send authorization of the
     transaction (e.g., "transaction granted") to the IAS 1014 for providing
     to the merchant system 130. Simultaneous with or subsequent to, providing
     the transaction authorization to the IAS 1014, the PLAS 1016 may seek
     satisfaction of the transaction from the fob value account maintained on
     the account provider database 1012. The transaction request may be
     provided to the IAS 1014 for processing. That is, the IAS 1014 may seek
     to deduct the transaction value from the balance of the amount stored in
     the preloaded value account.
<BR><BR>[0123]FIG. 12 depicts an exemplary embodiment of another transaction
     processing system ("direct link" system) 1200 in accordance with the
     present invention. More particularly, FIG. 12 depicts a direct link
     system 1200 which may be used to process a merchant transaction request.
     In this context, a direct link system may be any system which facilitates
     satisfaction of a transaction request using a fob or other presentable
     medium (credit card, charge card, debit card, etc.) directly linked to an
     account which stores an exchange value (e.g., money, credit or charge, or
     rewards points, etc.). In this instance, the preloaded value account may
     not be preloaded as described above. Further, the preloaded value account
     may be linked to a contact product such as a credit, debit, and/or DDA
     card, and the like, which may be presented for payment of goods and
     services. In this regard, the fob (here called "direct link fob") and the
     card are associated with the same funding source and the user or merchant
     may seek satisfaction of a transaction from the funding source
     independent of whether the direct link fob or card is used.
<BR><BR>[0124]In the exemplary direct link system 1200, the direct link fob 102
     user may not establish a preloaded value account with value. Instead, the
     preloaded value account may perpetually store a zero value or the fob 102
     may be associated with a fob transaction account which may be used to
     provide payment to the merchant for goods and services where the account
     may be a credit, debit, loyalty account or the like.
<BR><BR>[0125]In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention, a
     transaction request associated with a direct link fob 102 may be
     processed using the preloaded value transaction system processing
     described above. However, as noted, in this instance the preloaded value
     account is used as a place holder storing a zero value. A transaction
     account containing a transaction account value which is associated with
     the direct link fob is treated as the funding source for satisfying
     direct link transactions. In this instance, the transaction may be
     satisfied according to a fob user or issuer predefined protocol or
     criteria.
<BR><BR>[0126]As shown, the merchant system 130 may be in communication with an
     issuer system 1010 for receiving a merchant transaction request. More
     particularly, the POS device 110 may be in communication with an issuer
     server, such as, for example, an issuer account server (IAS) 1014 for
     receiving the merchant and/or transaction identifying information. IAS
     1014 may be in further communication with a PLAS 1016 for processing the
     merchant transaction request. In some instances the PLAS 1016 may be in
     further communication with a second IAS 1202, although a second IAS 1202
     may not be required where one or more of the existing servers may perform
     the functions of IAS 1202 described below. However, the IAS 1202 is
     included herein to simplify the understanding the operation of this
     exemplary embodiment.
<BR><BR>[0127]In exemplary operation of system 1200, the direct link fob
     identifying information (e.g., fob identifier or account number) may be
     provided to the POS device 110 in similar manner as was discussed with
     respect to FIG. 1A. That is, the direct link fob 102 may be presented to
     the merchant system 130 via an RFID reader 104 or a computer interface
     134, which may provide the direct link fob 102 identifying information in
     Track 1 or Track 2 format. A POS device 110 included in the merchant
     system 130 may receive the direct link fob 102 identifying information
     and provide the direct link fob 102 identifying information along with
     the transaction identifying information (e.g., amount, quantity, merchant
     identification, etc.) to the issuer system 1010 for authorization.
<BR><BR>[0128]The IAS 1014 may receive the transaction and fob identifying
     information and recognize that the transaction as being requested
     relative to a direct link fob 102. Recognition of the direct link fob 102
     in this instance may mean that the direct link fob 102 identifying
     information includes a marker or identifier indicating that the fob is
     associated with a zero value preloaded value account. Upon recognition of
     the marker, the IAS 1014 may forward the transaction and fob identifying
     information to PLAS 1016 for processing.
<BR><BR>[0129]In similar manner as was described with respect to the operation of
     the preloaded value processing system of FIG. 10, the PLAS 1016 may
     evaluate the transaction request based upon several risk criteria
     established by the issuer. Exemplary risk criteria may include, but are
     not limited to, consideration of transaction amount limits for a
     specified time period, fob user usage history, fund or reserve limits,
     pre-determined re-funding rules, user defined limits, etc. If all the
     criteria are successfully met, then the PLAS 1016 may send authorization
     of the transaction (e.g., "transaction granted") to the IAS 1014 for
     providing to the merchant system 130. The transaction authorization may
     be provided to the merchant system 130 based on evaluation of the risk
     criteria and not upon the value present in preloaded value account or
     direct link transaction account storing value relative to the direct link
     fob.
<BR><BR>[0130]After providing the transaction authorization to the IAS 1014, the
     PLAS 1016 may seek authorization of the transaction against the direct
     link fob account (e.g., transaction account) which is maintained on the
     issuer database 1012, and which is funded by value received from a
     funding source 1104. The authorization request may be provided to the IAS
     1202 for approval which may retrieve the necessary value from the direct
     link fob account. For example, where the direct link fob account is a
     charge or credit account, the PLAS 1016 may request authorization from
     the second IAS 1202 and the IAS 1202 may assess the transaction amount
     against the direct link fob account on database 1012. The IAS 1202 may
     seek to record the amount of the transaction in the direct link fob usage
     history data file for payment at the end of a billing cycle (e.g., charge
     account), or the amount may be recorded on the fob direct link fob usage
     data file for payment at a date later than the end of the billing cycle
     (e.g., credit account).
<BR><BR>[0131]In an alternative operation the PLAS 1016 may assess the transaction
     amount against the direct link fob account, without use of a second IAS
     1202. Whether the transaction is processed using a second IAS 1202, it is
     to be understood that value may not be immediately transferred to the
     merchant system from the direct link fob account for satisfying the
     transaction. Instead, the direct link fob issuer guarantees satisfaction
     of the merchant transaction request until the necessary value is
     retrieved from the direct link fob account at the end of the billing
     cycle or later.
<BR><BR>[0132]In yet another exemplary transaction processing system 1300 depicted
     in FIG. 13, the merchant system 130 may provide a batch file containing
     multiple fob transaction requests to be processed to a process server
     1302 where the multiple fob transactions may include both preloaded value
     and direct link transaction request. The system 1300 may include a
     process server 1302 which distinguished between preloaded value and
     direct link transaction requests. That is, process server 1302 may be
     used for separating the fob transactions which are associated with a
     preloaded fob account and those that are not associated with a preloaded
     fob account, as discussed more fully below. The process server 1302 may
     further be in communication with an IAS 1014 for seeking settlement of
     the transaction. The IAS 1014 may process the transaction request in
     accordance with the direct link transaction process or the preloaded
     value transaction platform described above.
<BR><BR>[0133]In exemplary operation of system 1300, the process server 1302 may
     receive the settlement file and create sub-files of transaction requests
     relative to the type of fob used in the transaction (e.g., preloaded fob,
     and direct link fob associated with a charge or credit account). The
     process server 1302 may create a first fob transaction file for merchant
     payables and a second fob transaction file for accounts receivable to be
     forwarded to the IAS 1014 for processing. Where the sub-file includes
     merchant payable, the process server 1302 may provide funds to the
     merchant for payment of the transaction, where the funds provided may be
     equivalent to the transaction amount minus discount revenues. The funds
     may be retrieved from the funding source for providing to the merchant.
     Alternatively, the process server 1302 may create a second fob
     transaction file for accounts receivable payments and forwarded the
     second fob transaction file to the IAS 1014. IAS 1014 may then process
     the transaction request according to the processes described in FIGS. 10
     and 12. That is, the IAS 1014 may distinguish the preloaded fob
     transaction requests from those associated with the direct link fob and
     process the transactions accordingly.
<BR><BR>[0134]Considering the operation of the various transaction processing
     systems described above, it can be seen that the transaction processing
     systems described may distinguish when a preloaded fob is used, when a
     card associated with a fob is used, or when an account associated with a
     preloaded fob is reloaded. In that regard, the present invention may be
     used to reward points depending on the nature of the fob usage. The
     points (e.g., loyalty points) may be stored in a points or rewards
     account maintained on the issuer database (e.g., database 1012). The
     rewards points may then later be redeemed from the rewards account for
     exchange for goods and services as desired by the fob user.
<BR><BR>[0135]As noted, in one instance, points may be provided when the fob is
     used as opposed to when the card associated with the fob is used. For
     example, the IAS 1014 may recognize that a fob is being used and award
     points (e.g., loyalty points) to the rewards account assigned to the fob
     user or associated with the fob. The loyalty points may be awarded based
     on any criteria as determined by the fob issuer. Exemplary rewarding
     criteria may include rewarding points for, for example, frequency of fob
     usage, amount of individual purchase using the fob, or the total amount
     of purchases in a given time period.
<BR><BR>[0136]Where the fob is associated with a preloaded value account such as
     that described with respect to FIG. 10, points may be awarded for account
     reloading. That is, IAS 1014 may place award points in the rewards
     account relative to the amount loaded or reloaded as required. Further
     the IAS 1014 may place reward points in the rewards account relative to
     usage of the fob at a particular merchant or for a particular
     transaction.
<BR><BR>[0137]It should be noted that the transaction account associated with the
     fob 102 may include a usage restriction, such as, for example, a per
     purchase spending limit, a time of day use, a day of week use, certain
     merchant use and/or the like, wherein an additional verification is
     required when using the fob outside of the restriction. The restrictions
     may be personally assigned by the fob 102 user, or the account provider.
     For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the account may be established
     such that purchases above $X (i.e., the spending limit) must be verified
     by the customer. Such verification may be provided using a suitable
     personal identification number (PIN) which may be recognized by the RFID
     reader 104 or a payment authorization center (not shown) as being unique
     to the fob 102 holder (e.g., customer) and the correlative fob 102
     transaction account number. Where the requested purchase is above the
     established per purchase spending limit, the customer may be required to
     provide, for example, a PIN, biometric sample and/or similar secondary
     verification to complete the transaction.
<BR><BR>[0138]Where a verification PIN is used as secondary verification the
     verification PIN may be checked for accuracy against a corroborating PIN
     which correlates to the fob 102 transaction account number. The
     corroborating PIN may be stored locally (e.g., on the fob 102, or on the
     RFID reader 104) or may be stored on a database (not shown) at the
     payment authorization center. The payment authorization center database
     may be any database maintained and operated by the fob 102 transaction
     account provider.
<BR><BR>[0139]The verification PIN may be provided to the POS device 110 using a
     conventional merchant (e.g., POS) PIN key pad 118 in communication with
     the POS device 110 as shown in FIG. 1, or an RFID keypad in communication
     with the RFID reader 104. PIN keypad may be in communication with the POS
     device 110 (or alternatively, RFID reader 104) using any conventional
     data link described above. Upon receiving the verification PIN, the RFID
     reader 104 may seek to match the PIN to the corroborating PIN stored on
     the RFID reader 104 at database 310 or 320. Alternatively, the
     verification PIN may be provided to a payment authorization center to
     determine whether the PIN matches the PIN stored on the payment
     authorization center database which correlates to the fob 102 account. If
     a match is made, the purchase may no longer be restricted, and the
     transaction may be allowed to be completed.
<BR><BR>[0140]In an alternate embodiment, verification of purchases exceeding the
     established spending limit may involve biometrics circuitry included in
     fob 102. FIG. 9 is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary fob 102
     wherein fob 102 includes a biometric security system 902. Biometric
     security system 902 may include a biometric sensor 904 for sensing the
     fingerprint of the fob 102 user. The biometric sensor 902 may be in
     communication with a sensor interface/driver 906 for receiving the sensor
     fingerprint and activating the operation of fob 102. In communication
     with the biometric sensor 904 and sensor interface 906 may be a battery
     903 for providing the necessary power for operation of the biometric
     security system components.
<BR><BR>[0141]In one exemplary application of the fob 102 including the biometric
     security system 902, the customer may place his finger on the biometric
     sensor to initiate the mutual authentication process between the fob 102
     and the RFID reader 104, or to provide secondary verification of the
     user's identity. The sensor fingerprint may be digitized and compared
     against a digitized fingerprint stored in a database (e.g., security
     database 212) included on fob 102. Such comparison step may be controlled
     by protocol/sequence controller 208 and may be validated by
     authentication circuit 210. Where such verification is made, the mutual
     authentication between fob 102 and RFID reader 104 may begin, and the
     transaction may proceed accordingly. Alternatively, the comparison may be
     made with a digitized fingerprint stored on a database maintained by the
     fob 102 transaction account provider system (not shown). The digitized
     fingerprint may be verified in much the same way as is described above
     with respect to the PIN.
<BR><BR>[0142]In one exemplary application of the fob 102 including the biometric
     security system 902, the system 902 may be used to authorize a purchase
     exceeding the established per purchase spending limit. In this case,
     where the customer's intended purchase exceeds the spending limit, the
     customer may be asked to provide assurance that the purchase is
     authorized. Accordingly, the customer may provide such verification by
     placing his finger over the biometric sensor 904. The biometric sensor
     904 may then digitize the fingerprint and provide the digitized
     fingerprint for verification as described above. Once verified, fob 102
     may provide a transaction authorized signal to RF transponder 202 (or
     alternatively to transponder 220) for forwarding to RFID reader 104. RFID
     reader 104 may then provide the transaction authorized signal to the POS
     device 110 in similar manner as is done with convention PIN driven
     systems and the POS device 110 may process the transaction under the
     merchant's business as usual standard.
<BR><BR>[0143]In accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention,
     the fob user is provided limited access to a fob user data file
     maintained on an issuer system for managing the fob usage and fob user
     information. The fob user may access the fob user data file to change,
     for example, demographic information (e.g., fob user address, phone
     number, email address, etc.), the funding source (e.g., credit account,
     charge account, rewards account, barter account, etc.) associated with
     the fob, view the transaction history, etc. In addition, the fob user may
     be permitted to load or reload the account or alter automatic reload
     parameters (e.g., amount to reload, period for reloading, etc.).
<BR><BR>[0144]With reference to FIG. 1A, the fob user may connect the fob 102 to a
     computer interface 134 via the USB interface 132. The fob user may then
     use the computer interface 134 to access the fob user data file via the
     network 136. In particular, the network 136 may be in communication with
     an issuer system (e.g. system 1010 of FIG. 10) and may be provided
     limited access to an issuer server (e.g., server 1014) for managing the
     fob. The issuer server 1014 may be in communication with an issuer system
     database (e.g., 1012) which stores the information to be managed relative
     to the user fob user data file. The changes made to the fob user data
     file by the fob user may be made in real-time, after a brief delay, or
     after an extended delay. In one instance, changes may be stored in a
     batch changes file on the issuer database for later batch processing.
<BR><BR>[0145]The fob user may be provided limited access to all or a portion of
     the issuer system 1010 to define a funding protocol for use in satisfying
     a transaction request. The fob user may be permitted access to all or a
     portion of the issuer database 1012 for defining the protocol for
     determining the funding source to be used for a particular transaction.
     The user may contact the provider or any other third party that can
     facilitate changing the funding source via any means known in the art
     such as, for example, telephone, voice response, internet, cell phone,
     modem, email, webpage submission and/or any other electronic, optical or
     digital methods for communication. The fob user may be permitted to
     select one or more particular funding source for use with the fob
     depending on the conditions of the transaction request. For example, the
     funding protocol may indicate to the issuer (e.g., account provider)
     server (e.g. IAS 1014) that a particular funding source is to be used for
     an identified class of transactions or for a particular merchant. The
     funding protocol may take into account the requirements as determined by
     a particular funding source, or the relative risk level (e.g., high risk,
     medium risk, low risk, or the like) in determining which funding source
     or combination of sources are to be used to satisfy a transaction
     request. Alternatively, the funding protocol may indicate that a
     combination of sources may be used to satisfy a transaction request. In
     this arrangement, the primary, secondary, tertiary funding sources may
     have similar descriptions as any one of funding sources 1104 described
     above. In this regard, the database 1012 may include sub-data files
     corresponding to one or more funding sources, where the sub-data files
     may funded from value received from the multiple funding sources. For
     example, a primary sub-data file may include value received from a
     primary funding source and a secondary sub-data file may include value
     received from a secondary funding source. Alternatively, the invention
     may include multiple databases (not shown) for uniquely storing the funds
     received from, for example, a primary and secondary funding source.
     Further, although the invention is described with respect to primary and
     secondary funding source, it is to be understood that any number n of
     funding sources for providing value to n sub-data files is contemplated,
     and that the terms primary and secondary are used herein by way of
     example. In one exemplary embodiment, where multiple funding sources are
     used to satisfy a transaction, the invention may require authentication
     from one or more of the funding sources that the transaction is
     authorized. Thus, an authorization may take place upon presentment of the
     fob 102 and when the value is retrieved from a funding source (or
     multiple funding sources) to complete a transaction.
<BR><BR>[0146]FIG. 14 depicts an exemplary funding protocol 1400 which may be
     identified by the fob user. As shown, the funding protocol may be
     initiated when the fob 102 is presented for payment (step 1402). The fob
     102 may be presented to an RFID reader 104. The RFID reader 104 or the
     computer interface 134 may provide an account number to the merchant
     system 130 and the merchant system 130 may seek satisfaction of a
     transaction request from an issuer system 1010 (step 1404).
<BR><BR>[0147]The fob 102 user may indicate via the database 1012 that a
     particular merchant or class of transactions is to be flagged or marked
     for satisfaction using a particular funding source. The merchant or class
     of transactions may be flagged in similar manner as is discussed above.
     That is, the fob user defined protocol may provide for a particular
     merchant, type of merchant, or class of transactions to be marked and
     identified by the account provider for specified treatment, as described
     more fully below.
<BR><BR>[0148]If a merchant (or transaction) is flagged, the issuer server 1014
     may switch the funding source associated with the fob 102 from a primary
     funding source to a secondary funding source (step 1408). In this regard,
     the server may retrieve value from the sub-data file associated with the
     secondary funding source. The server 1014 may additionally determine
     whether the spending limit for the secondary funding source has been
     reached or exceeded (step 1410). If the spending limit for the secondary
     funding sources is not exceeded, then the server may retrieve the
     appropriate value for satisfying a transaction request from the secondary
     funding source (step 1414). The funds may then be transferred to the
     merchant system 130 under any business as usual standard (step 1416),
     completing the merchant's transaction request.
<BR><BR>[0149]In some instances, the funding may be switched from the primary
     funding source to the secondary funding source (step 1408), and the
     spending limit for the secondary funding source is reached or exceeded
     (step 1410). In which case, the issuer server 1014 may determine whether
     the fob user has indicated that the merchant transaction request is to be
     satisfied using funds retrieved from a combination of funds received from
     the sub-data files associated with the primary and secondary funding
     sources (step 1412). The combination of funds may be retrieved using any
     formula determined by the fob user or fob account issuer (step 1430), and
     the funds may be transferred to the merchant system 1014, satisfying the
     merchant transaction request.
<BR><BR>[0150]In another embodiment, the server may determine if a switch is to be
     made to yet a tertiary funding source (step 1432). In which case, the
     server may determine if the spending limit for the tertiary funding
     source has been reached or exceeded (step 1436). If the funds are
     exceeded, the merchant request may be terminated and a "transaction
     denied" message may be forwarded to the merchant system 130 (step 1434).
<BR><BR>[0151]Where a merchant transaction request is not flagged (step 1406), in
     one embodiment, the issuer server 1014 may not switch from a primary
     funding source to a secondary funding source. Instead, the issuer server
     1014 may determine whether the spending limit on the primary source is
     reached or exceeded (step 1420). If the spending limit on the primary
     source is not exceeded, then the appropriate funds for satisfying the
     merchant request may be retrieved from the primary funding source
     sub-data file (step 1422) and transferred to the merchant system 130
     under business as usual standards (step 1424).
<BR><BR>[0152]Contrarily, where the spending limit on the primary funding source
     is reached or exceeded (step 1420), in one embodiment, the issuer server
     1014 may determine whether to combine funds retrieved from sub-data files
     associated with the primary funding source and a secondary funding source
     to satisfy the merchant transaction request (step 1426). If the primary
     and secondary funding sources are to be combined, funds may be retrieved
     from the multiple funding sub-data files using any formula as determined
     by the fob user or fob account issuer (step 1430). The funds may then be
     transferred to the merchant system 130 under business as usual standards
     (step 1424).
<BR><BR>[0153]If the funds from the primary and secondary funding sources are not
     to be combined, the server may determine whether to switch from a primary
     funding source to a secondary funding source (step 1428). If no switch is
     to be made and the transaction request exceeds the primary funding source
     limit, then the transaction request may be terminated and a "transaction
     denied" may be provided to the merchant under business as usual standards
     (step 1434).
<BR><BR>[0154]On the other hand, should the funding source be switched from a
     primary funding source to a secondary funding source, the server 1014 may
     determine whether the spending limit for the secondary funding source is
     reached or exceeded (step 1440). If the spending limit for the secondary
     funding source is reached or exceeded, then the transaction may be
     terminated and a "transaction denied" message may be provided to the
     merchant system 130 under business as usual standards (step 1434). If the
     spending limit for the secondary funding source is not reached or
     exceeded, the appropriate funds for satisfying the transaction request
     may be retrieved from the sub-data file associated with the secondary
     funding source (step 1442) and transferred to the merchant system 130
     (step 1424), satisfying the transaction request.
