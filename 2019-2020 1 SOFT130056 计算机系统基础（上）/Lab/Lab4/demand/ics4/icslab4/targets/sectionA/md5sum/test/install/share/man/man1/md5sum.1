.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Print or check MD5 (128\-bit) checksums.
.PP
With no FILE, or when FILE is \-, read standard input.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
read in binary mode
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
read MD5 sums from the FILEs and check them
.TP
\fB\-\-tag\fR
create a BSD\-style checksum
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
read in text mode (default)
.SS "The following four options are useful only when verifying checksums:"
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't print OK for each successfully verified file
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
don't output anything, status code shows success
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
The sums are computed as described in RFC 1321.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a
line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary,
\&' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
.SH BUGS
The MD5 algorithm should not be used any more for security related purposes.
Instead, better use an SHA\-2 algorithm, implemented in the programs
sha224sum(1), sha256sum(1), sha384sum(1), sha512sum(1)
